            <title>DHS watchdog calls for removal of ICE detainees due to "egregious" conditions in New Mexico facility</title>
            <link>https://www.axios.com/dhs-ice-detainees-removal-poor-living-conditions-2eaf60c7-14c0-46a5-9c0b-fb4d496227cf.html</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security inspector general on Friday released a report calling for the "immediate removal" of all detainees from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in New Mexico due to "egregious" living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Inspector General Joseph Cuffari issued a "&lt;a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-03/OIG-22-31-Mar22-mgmtalert_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;management alert&lt;/a&gt;" directing ICE to address "the critical staffing shortages that have led to safety risks and unsanitary living conditions at the Torrance County Detention Facility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is the first time that the DHS inspector general calls for the immediate removal of detainees from an ICE facility, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/politics/dhs-ice-immigration-facility-conditions/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports, citing a DHS spokesperson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;In the report, Cuffari's said detainees must be relocated until the facility can ensure "adequate staffing and appropriate living conditions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inspector general's office conducted an unannounced inspection between Feb. 1 and 3, 2022. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unannounced inspections are required in order "to ensure compliance with detention standards."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;The Torrance facility should have 245 staff members. However, at the time of the inspection, there were only 133 employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DHS found that 53% of detainee cells had toilets and sinks that were "non-functioning" or "clogged." Pictures in the report showed how these were moldy and "full of human waste."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were also "security lapses" in the facility, with the report finding that "Torrance officers did properly supervise and monitor detainees in the housing units" due to "poor sight lines" and "blind spots" in certain locations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;ICE has disagreed with the inspector general's conclusions, and leadership said the recommendation to remove detainees is unwarranted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"ICE is fiercely committed to ensuring that noncitizens in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments,"  ICE Acting Chief of Staff Jason Houser said in a memo to the inspector general, per CNN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"While ICE leadership continues to work on improving conditions at the (facility) in Estancia, New Mexico, we do not agree with the OIG's overall conclusion that it does not provide a safe, secure, and humane environment."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;House said it appears that Cuffari's office has "falsified or mischaracterized evidence and ignored facts."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS inspector general's office and ICE did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>UN warns Ukraine's food supply chain is "falling apart"</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine's food supply chain is "falling apart" under stress from Russia's invasion, potentially undermining food security around the world, the United Nations &lt;a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1e/k1e1glm25j" target="_blank"&gt;warned on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The World Food Program said wheat shipments were largely on hold from both Russia and Ukraine, which combined account for 30% of the world's wheat trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jakob Kern, a senior manager at the World Food Program, warned of "collateral hunger" in some Middle Eastern countries that rely heavily on Ukraine for wheat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lebanon in particular imports more than 60% of its wheat from Ukraine, Kern said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;Kern said that the World Food Program has mobilized food supplies for the more than 3 million people immediately affected, but said it would need more resources to fill food insecurities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The price of wheat has gone up substantially this year. Kern said a combination of inflation and the invasion has led prices to go up by about $70 million to feed 4 million people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"The consequences of the conflict in Ukraine, are radiating outwards, triggering a wave of collateral hunger across the globe," Kern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Food insecurity and in turn food into insecurity increases the chances of unrest and violence. Ukraine is the catalyst of compounding what is already a year of catastrophic karma," he added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UN Secretary-General António Guterres&lt;/strong&gt; this week &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/node/262391" target="_blank"&gt;urged countries&lt;/a&gt; to consider the global consequences of Russia's invasion, saying "this war goes far beyond Ukraine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It is also an assault on the world’s most vulnerable people and countries," he added. "All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/humanitarian-crisis-afghanistan-yemen-ethiopia-ukraine-d314cdc0-4c4d-4381-8d3d-52ce17f6f0ab.html" target="_blank"&gt;UN leaders urge the world to not forget about other global crises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Zelensky says hundreds still trapped under Mariupol theater bombed by Russia</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/zelensky-hundreds-trapped-theater-bombed-by-russia-485f0ec1-71f7-48e4-adc7-2b22b2325b5f.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people are still trapped underneath a theater in Mariupol, Ukraine, that was being used as a civilian shelter before it was bombed by Russian forces earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in &lt;a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/videos/atakuyuchi-ukrayinu-rosiya-znishit-use-chogo-dosyagla-za-min-2189" target="_blank"&gt;a televised address&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest:&lt;/strong&gt; Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's top human rights official, said &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSKCN2LF11K" target="_blank"&gt;130 people had been rescued&lt;/a&gt; from the destroyed building as of Friday. That would represent only a small fraction of the over 1,000 people, including children, that &lt;a href="https://t.me/s/mariupolrada" target="_blank"&gt;city officials said&lt;/a&gt; were inside shelters beneath the theater at the time of the strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The officials also said earlier this week that rescue operations have been complicated by almost-constant attacks on the city from Russian forces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "There are still hundreds of Mariupol residents under the rubble. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue the rescue work," Zelensky said during the address, according to a translation from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-says-130-people-have-been-rescued-so-far-bombed-mariupol-theatre-2022-03-18/" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days before the bombing,&lt;/strong&gt; Maxar Technologies had captured the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre in the port city of Mariupol in &lt;a href="https://maxar.mediavalet.com/galleries/61be2dbb-80e7-401f-8a32-6c9e72bb894c_0e47db62-15e9-431c-b01e-585a52144601-ExternalUser" target="_blank"&gt;a satellite image&lt;/a&gt;, which showed the word "children" written in Russian in large white letters in front of and behind the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The distinct red-roofed theatre is also relatively far away from other buildings in a park.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Russian forces have &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-russian-invasion-ukraine-ea623eb5-4a14-4458-9640-af981081e4a4.html" target="_blank"&gt;besieged&lt;/a&gt; and indiscriminately bombed civilian buildings — including &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/mariupol-shelling-russia-ukraine-25359776-cee5-4fe9-bf61-3b5655bec036.html" target="_blank"&gt;a children's hospital&lt;/a&gt; — in Mariupol for several days, leading to shortages of food, water and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that the city, which was once home to around 430,000 people, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/red-cross-mariupol-aad42655-2a12-4a91-8d4a-bd59ecd19417.html" target="_blank"&gt;faces a "worst-case scenario"&lt;/a&gt; unless humanitarian corridors can be opened.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-missile-lviv-874d1e6f-04ca-4945-bea8-821849bc17d0.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russia strikes aircraft facility in Lviv, shattering city's relative peace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Biden and Xi hold first call since Russia invaded Ukraine</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/biden-xi-jinping-call-russia-ukraine-china-589b2602-5b83-46ac-8c8f-7b8771490374.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours on Friday in a video call that came as the U.S. tries to convince Beijing to distance itself from Russia's war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest: &lt;/strong&gt;Xi told Biden that "conflict and confrontation are not in anyone’s interest," and that the Ukraine crisis was "not something we want to see,"&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1504828021131251720" target="_blank"&gt; according to China's Foreign Ministry&lt;/a&gt;. The White House has not provided a readout of the call beyond the fact that it lasted one hour and 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was the first call between the leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;China has not publicly condemned or defended its most powerful partner's invasion of Ukraine, but Chinese officials and state media have largely put the blame on the U.S. and the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FT &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/52ea7aab-f8d1-46b6-9d66-18545c5ef9b9" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that China has shown willingness to provide Russia with weapons, raising fears of a superpower proxy war with the U.S. and China arming either side in Ukraine. Chinese officials denied having received any request for arms from Moscow, and there are no indications that any such efforts have been set in motion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In an "intense" seven-hour meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi on Monday in Rome — which appears to have set the stage for Friday's call — national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned of "consequences" if Beijing materially supports &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_self"&gt;Russia's war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, a senior U.S. official briefed reporters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ahead of Friday's call, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said Biden would “make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; The approach of Chinese state media has shifted in recent days, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/18/world/ukraine-russia-war?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes#china-media-russia-ukraine-war" target="_blank"&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BeijingPalmer/status/1504663290282192898" target="_blank"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;, to include more coverage of Russian attacks, civilian casualties, and speeches by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday that China was “deeply grieved by the increasing number of civilian casualties" and called for a ceasefire, per the New York Times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a breaking news story and will be updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gambling regulators in two states are investigating Penn National Gaming over concerns with Barstool Sports and its founder Dave Portnoy, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dave-portnoy-accusations-prompt-scrutiny-of-barstool-as-penn-national-pursues-acquisition-11647511200" target="_blank"&gt;Wall Street Journal reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Penn's acquisition of Barstool always had brand risk, but now it also has business risk that could result in losing gambling licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;WSJ reported Thursday that gambling regulators in Nevada and Indiana are looking into Penn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a December hearing for Penn CFO Felicia Hendrix, Nevada Gaming Control board chairman Brin Gibson expressed concern and asked for information about Barstool and Portnoy, &lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-gaming-in-play-wagering-could-influence-nevadas-handle-for-super-bowl-lvi" target="_blank"&gt;The Nevada Independent reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A spokesperson for the gaming board tells Kerry its investigation of Penn and Portnoy is ongoing but declined to comment on specifics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via email, Gibson says the board's obligation "is to protect the reputation of the state and the reputation of the state's gaming industry."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Indiana Gaming Commission tells Kerry it "is conducting a review of this matter as it pertains to Penn's responsibilities as a licensee. Penn is aware of the IGC's ongoing concerns and we will continue to evaluate any new information that emerges."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Penn's Barstool Sports app operates in Indiana but not Nevada. However, Penn has casinos in Nevada.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; Penn &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/penn-national-barstool-sports-purchase-ea9de464-ff18-4674-bfe8-209bf93bd44f.html" target="_blank"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; a 36% share in Barstool in January 2020 and plans to buy the rest in early 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://pennnationalgaming.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/penn-national-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-revenues-16-billion" target="_blank"&gt;Penn's latest earnings call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With Barstool, Penn can grow its reach through the media brand's built-in audience, but Barstool is rife with controversy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The site has long been accused of publishing &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/barstool-sports-persistence-traditional-masculinity-sports-culture-n1057061" target="_blank"&gt;sexist content&lt;/a&gt; and promoting a culture of &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-barstool-sports-culture-of-online-hate-they-treat-sexual-harassment-and-cyberbullying-as-a-game" target="_blank"&gt;cyberbullying and harassment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Portnoy's list of offenses include &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/barstool-sports-settles-with-labor-board-over-anti-union-tweets" target="_blank"&gt;threatening&lt;/a&gt; to fire employees who sought to unionize and using racist language, including the N-word, and then &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-racist-language-videos-1234693013/" target="_blank"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insider has published &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-sex-choking-violent-stoolies" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dave-portnoy-new-women-sexual-misconduct-allegations-filming-sex-without-permission" target="_blank"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; detailing sexual misconduct allegations against Portnoy, which he has denied and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-sex-video-lawsuit-insider-1235171273/" target="_blank"&gt;filed a defamation suit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;Portnoy &lt;a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/barstool-investigation-nevada-indiana" target="_blank"&gt;told the Action Network&lt;/a&gt; that the regulators "wouldn't be doing their job" if they did not investigate the allegations in the Insider articles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But Portnoy continued to deny them. "After being presented with all the facts surrounding the story and not just a one sided smear campaign by Business Insider everybody associated with me both personally and professionally have stuck with me because I proved the allegations have zero merit," he said. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barstool CEO Erika Nardini &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/barstool-difference-dave-portnoy-erika-nardini-1d224a2d-80c1-439a-bac8-e419f4e1bc5c.html" target="_blank"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; she found Insider's stories to be "shoddy journalism" for not correcting claims of inaccuracies presented by Portnoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Penn CEO Jay Snowden has also stood by, telling WSJ he finds Portnoy "to be very honest." He said the allegations were about Portnoy's personal life and that he is not a Penn employee. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next: &lt;/strong&gt;Snowden told WSJ that Portnoy will remain involved in Penn, but there's no set organizational structure yet. He may announce those details in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Companies must consider &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-money-information-disclosure-investors-2df06559-3aa7-4080-8212-7dac999ad4df.html" target="_blank"&gt;far more than financials&lt;/a&gt; when dealmaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kerry Flynn co-authors the Axios Pro Media deals newsletter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/offer?utm_source=website&amp;amp;utm_medium=CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pro_free-article_CTA_03-22" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sign up now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Inside the bidding war for Chelsea FC</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/chelsea-sale-bidding-war-98c08833-b28f-4fdd-aff6-183c224e40c8.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;First-round bids are due today for Chelsea FC, the Premier League soccer club that's being sold by sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be the highest-profile, fastest and most complex sports team sale ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It also may be the most competitive. For every prospective bidder you've read about, I'm told there's at least one you haven't. This includes a bunch of folks who've never before sniffed at a pro sports team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Chelsea is a top club in the middle of the biggest market in the best league in the world's most popular sport. There's just no historical comp. Maybe if the Clippers or Mets were the Lakers or Yankees, but they aren't. And there's no expectation that another London team will be on the block again for at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; It's been just two weeks since Abramovich said he'd sell the team, and first bids are already due. Normally, that would be at least a multiple-month process. And don't be surprised if the second round is a very fast follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt; The British government is playing a major role here, although its interest in securing a U.K. owner is said to be overstated. Instead, its prime interest is getting this done quickly and without too much drama, which means past controversies will work against prospective bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also the matter of where proceeds will go, as Abramovich has pledged them to charity. Or, more specifically, how they will get routed to a charity without first violating the sanctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also not entirely clear who picks the winner. Abramovich? The government? Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck? Or Raine Group, which was charged with managing the process? A combination of two or three of those?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; As you all know, first prize is Chelsea. Anybody wanna see second prize? Second prize is the Denver Broncos, if you want it. Third prize is you’re buying tickets like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Russia crisis spurs push to cut oil use</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/a-10-point-plan-to-cut-oil-use" target="_blank"&gt;just unveiled ideas&lt;/a&gt; for quickly cutting oil demand at a time when Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine could bring substantial loss of Russian barrels from global markets&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The 10-point plan comes amid IEA warnings that the war could become the biggest supply crisis in decades as countries look to isolate Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's part of a wider reckoning in Europe — Russia's largest market — and elsewhere over how to curb reliance on Russia while keeping markets supplied and avoiding even greater economic shocks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom in: &lt;/strong&gt;The plan says that "immediate actions" in advanced economies could reduce global oil demand by about 2.7 million barrels per day within four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They include...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing highway speed limits by about 6 miles per hour; more working from home; street changes to encourage walking and cycling; car-free Sundays in cities and restrictions on other days; cutting transit fares; policies that encourage more carpooling; cutting business air travel; and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia is the world's largest combined exporter of crude and oil products combined and the second-largest crude exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The plan arrives two days after IEA projected that Russian exports could fall by around 2.5 million barrels per day next month and maybe more "should restrictions or public condemnation escalate."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; This all seems ... maybe hard to imagine?

    <title>Over 3 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian invasion began, UN says</title>

    <title>Russia strikes aircraft facility in Lviv, shattering city's relative peace</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/russia-missile-lviv-874d1e6f-04ca-4945-bea8-821849bc17d0.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian cruise missiles struck an airplane repair facility west of Lviv's international airport on Friday, Mayor Andriy Sadovy said, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/18/world/ukraine-russia-war#missiles-hit-lviv-a-safe-haven-until-now-the-mayor-says" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Lviv, which is roughly 50 miles east of Poland's border, has served as a safe haven for people fleeing fighting and seen relatively little action before Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sadovy said the repair plant was not operating at the time of the attack and no casualties were reported. A large plume of smoke could be seen rising from the city’s west after the attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the start of Russia's &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_self"&gt;unprovoked invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, the western portion of the country has seen comparatively little of the conflict so far, though Russia started striking more targets in the region over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Sunday, Russian missiles struck &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russian-missile-western-ukraine-35-0884935a-ec2c-49c5-a94c-aaa31676f9dc.html" target="_blank"&gt;a military training facility&lt;/a&gt; near the Ukraine-Poland border, killing at least 35 people and prompting warnings from NATO countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the defensive alliance would respond to any attack on NATO territory — even an accidental strike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A senior U.S. defense official&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2970504/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing/" target="_blank"&gt;during a background briefing&lt;/a&gt; Thursday said there have been more than 1,000 observed missile launches by Russian against Ukraine so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The official said that Russian forces appear to be increasingly relying on non-precision-guided munitions more than at the start of the invasion, which suggests that "they might be either conserving their precision-guided munitions or beginning to experience shortages."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/un-ukraine-civilian-casualties-investigation-call-80b45a30-697b-46a6-b04e-b29174605f88.html" target="_blank"&gt;Leaders call for probe into heavy civilian casualties in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Israel urges Biden admin not to remove IRGC from terror blacklist</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid issued a joint statement on Friday urging the Biden administration not to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/us-weighs-deal-remove-irans-irgc-from-blacklist-c4aa21ed-5b57-4be7-bce6-3670a5dac453.html" target="_blank"&gt;remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. blacklist of foreign terrorist organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Bennett and Lapid's statement was unusually strong in its criticism of the Biden administration, calling the proposed move "an insult to the victims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It reveals the impact a decision on the Revolutionary Guards have on U.S. relations with Israel and other allies in the region who have been targeted by the group and would see such a move as a betrayal by the Biden administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; On Wednesday, Axios reported that the Biden administration is considering removing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from a terror blacklist in return for a public commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal is nearly complete, but Iran's demand that President Biden reverse Donald Trump's decision to designate the IRGC as a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/" target="_blank"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organization&lt;/a&gt; is a key remaining sticking point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they are saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "The Iranian Revolutionary Guards are Hezbollah in Lebanon, they are Islamic Jihad in Gaza, they are the Houthis in Yemen, they are the militias in Iraq," Bennett and Lapid said. "The fight against terrorism is a global one, a shared mission of the entire world. We believe that the United States will not abandon its closest allies in exchange for empty promises from terrorists." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bennett and Lapid said, "The IRGC is responsible for attacks on American civilians and American forces throughout the Middle East, including in the past year." They added that the "IRGC was behind plans to assassinate senior American government officials."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The IRGC were involved in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians, they destroyed Lebanon and they are brutally oppressing Iranian civilians," Bennett and Lapid said. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They added: "We find it hard to believe that the IRGC’s designation as a terrorist organization will be removed in exchange for a promise not to harm Americans."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/us-weighs-deal-remove-irans-irgc-from-blacklist-c4aa21ed-5b57-4be7-bce6-3670a5dac453.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. weighs deal to remove Iran's IRGC from terror blacklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Chocolate and candy sales hit a record</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Consumers gobbled up a record $36.9 billion in candy,  gum, mints, chocolate and other confections in 2021 — and are poised to keep buying more, a new &lt;a href="https://candyusa.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SOTIC_2022_StateofTreating_Bite-Sized_Final_Online_NoBleed.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Confectioners Association says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;When times are tough, people turn to sweets to make themselves feel better. The pandemic not only gave people more license to buy goodies, it got them into the habit of buying them online and consuming them at home — for movie nights, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Candy and chocolate sales in 2021 were 11% higher than in 2020 and 15.4% higher than in 2019 — and the trade group &lt;a href="https://candyusa.com/sweet-insights-state-of-treating-2022" target="_blank"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; the rise to "the incredible permissibility our category enjoys based on the strong connection between emotional well-being and confectionery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sales are projected to reach $44.9 billion by 2026 — a 22% increase over 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social media has been helping drive candy sales. For instance, 42% of TikTokers engage in food challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Consumers view chocolate and candy as special treats in a happy, balanced lifestyle," John Downs, president &amp;amp; CEO of the National Confectioners Association, says in the report.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Our success in 2021 came in part as a result of Americans re-engaging with the confectionery seasons after a tumultuous 2020 in which we were often physically separated from family, friends and neighbors."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;Of the $36.9 billion in sales in 2021, chocolate represented the largest category, with $21.1 billion in sales, followed by "non-chocolate" ($12.7 billion) and gum and mints ($3.1 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;71% of consumers "mostly purchase chocolate and candy at their primary grocery store," the trade group says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;88% "share with family and friends at least half the time when buying chocolate and candy."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 91% of Americans who take road trips, 83% "sometimes or always include chocolate and candy in their travels."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intrigue: &lt;/strong&gt;The candy industry refers to "confectionary seasons" and says that 80% to 90% of Americans "celebrate the 'Big Four' seasons of Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween and the winter holidays by sharing and gifting confectionery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The industry sees "ample opportunity to drive sales during the secondary seasons" like Mother's Day, Father's Day, the summer holidays and the Super Bowl.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/strong&gt; June is National Candy Month — scheduled strategically to help fill "the confectionery sales gap between Easter and Halloween." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the last big spikes in sales of sweets happened in 2009 — the height of the big recession — when Americans, particularly adults, were "consuming growing volumes of candy, from Mary Janes and Tootsie Rolls to Gummy Bears and cheap chocolates," &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/nyregion/24candy.html" target="_blank"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Theories vary on exactly why," the Times said. "For many, sugar lifts spirits dragged low by the languishing economy. For others, candy also provides a nostalgic reminder of better times. And not insignificantly, it is relatively cheap."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yum:&lt;/strong&gt; M&amp;amp;Ms and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are locked in a perennial tie for America's favorite candy, &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/life/2022/03/whats-the-uss-favorite-candy-its-a-tie-says-study.html" target="_blank"&gt;by some reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Hospitals are back in the hot seat for their prices</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Forces in New York City, California and elsewhere are leading a new push to rein in hospital prices, reviving a health cost fight that’s been on hold for most of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Hospital prices vary considerably even in the same market, and rising prices for care are reflected in higher insurance premiums and lost wages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; A union health fund representing service workers in 11 states and Washington, D.C., is calling on New York State lawmakers for help and weighing whether to team up with other labor groups to gain leverage in negotiations with hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The effort drew praise Thursday from New York City Mayor Eric Adams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorado employers have already banded together to directly negotiate with local hospitals and insurance companies, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-colorado-new-healthcare-cost-plan/?sref=yLCixKPR" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for creating an &lt;a href="https://hcai.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Office-of-Health-Care-Affordability-Fact-Sheet-1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Health Care Affordability&lt;/a&gt; to set limits on hospital, physician and insurer costs -- and fine those that don't comply.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legislators in &lt;a href="https://www.nashp.org/health-system-costs-legislative-tracker/" target="_blank"&gt;half of the states&lt;/a&gt; have debated transparency bills that, among other things, would force hospitals to disclose prices or in some cases cap cost increases, per the National Academy for State Health Policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; The focus on hospital pricing is driven by a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hospital-prices-rising-e8177e89-519e-4c16-86d3-ea88b80cce12.html" target="_blank"&gt;growing gap&lt;/a&gt; between what employers, unions and private insurers pay hospitals compared with what Medicare pays for the same services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; The service workers union’s 32BJ Health Fund on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.32bjhealthfundinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HospitalPrices_online_screen-pages.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; showing private hospitals in New York City charged it on average 300% more than they charged Medicare for the same services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That gap also affects governments that buy coverage for active and retired employees. The union fund estimated New York City may be overpaying by as much as $2.4 billion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analysis of pricing trends at 10 major urban health systems contained in the report found major disparities in the cost of some common procedures. The union said a C-section delivery, for example, varied from $27,700 to $55,000 at New York City private hospital systems while costing $17,800 at the public Health + Hospitals system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Hospital prices are the main driver of our costs and U.S. healthcare spending -- findings that should direct policy change going forward,” the report states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side:&lt;/strong&gt; Hospitals have long argued that government programs like Medicare pay too little, and that they have to charge privately insured patients more to make ends meet. The pandemic has also disrupted many hospitals’ business models -- for example, by forcing the cancellation of elective procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; Old health cost fights are resurfacing as the pandemic ebbs, putting political pressure on providers that were hailed as heroes and seen as largely untouchable during the worst of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Ignoring abortion access is getting harder for companies</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Companies that never had to deal with abortion rights are now picking a side.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;After Texas &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/texas-abortion-ban-effect-f41bef97-09ac-4062-a933-d435a7e892d4.html" target="_blank"&gt;effectively banned the procedure&lt;/a&gt; last year, and with the Supreme Court potentially poised to roll back abortion rights, new restrictions could soon put more pressure on big businesses to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a rare event when a change to a company's insurance benefits makes news — but that's what happened this week when Citigroup mentioned in a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000831001/000120677422000697/citi3969751-def14a.htm" target="_blank"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; that it would cover travel expenses for U.S. employees seeking abortions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play:&lt;/strong&gt; Citi appears to be one of the first public companies to officially update its employee health care policy in response to the changing legal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple, which has a big presence in Texas, confirmed to Axios that its health insurance policies cover abortions, including travel fees if needed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's possible other employers have similar health insurance policies, but they haven't been talking about them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CEO of Match, another dating company, funded a program with Planned Parenthood to ensure her Texas-based employees receive safe and legal care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dating app company &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTS4rxHPEdr/?utm_medium=copy_link" target="_blank"&gt;Bumble&lt;/a&gt; helped create a relief fund, in conjunction with advocacy groups, to help women pay for reproductive care in Texas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth noting: &lt;/strong&gt;75% of these companies have female CEOs, compared to &lt;a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-ceos-of-the-sp-500/#:~:text=Rosalind%20Brewer%2C%20Walgreen%20Boots%20Alliance%2C%20Inc.&amp;amp;text=Debra%20A.,Cafaro%2C%20Ventas%2C%20Inc.&amp;amp;text=Jane%20Fraser%2C%20Citigroup%2C%20Inc." target="_blank"&gt;6% of the S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works: &lt;/strong&gt;Citi's policy is surprisingly uncomplicated.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Travel expenses are covered under an employee's health insurance, according to a source familiar with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The company plan already covers people with, say, a heart condition who need treatment at a far-off hospital. This is no different. The benefit would extend to employees in any state where access is restricted. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Extending the benefit promotes more equitable access to health care services and supports women's health," the source said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not only would travel expenses be reimbursed, but paid sick leave would cover any time off for an employee who needs to travel, get the procedure done and recover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Privacy shouldn't be an issue, the source said. Benefits are handled by an outside provider, so a woman's boss would have no reason to know details of her medical issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact: &lt;/strong&gt;The Citi policy should immediately help employees in Texas, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the state's abortion ban is already causing economic hardship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To travel for care, many have delayed paying bills and rent, taken out loans, or took days of unpaid time off, according to a &lt;a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/news/out-of-state-travel-for-abortion-following-implementation-of-texas-senate-bill-8-new-brief" target="_blank"&gt;study from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas at Austin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least one women was fired for taking time off, the report found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side:&lt;/strong&gt; Abortion opponents were quick to criticize Citi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Nothing more than a PR stunt by a ‘woke’ company to support a culture of death,” George P. Bush, the state's Republican land commissioner in the running for attorney general, told &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citi-draws-ire-of-texas-republicans-over-its-new-abortion-policy-1.1738714" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the Texas GOP chairman advised folks to avoid banking with Citi and other companies "hostile" to their values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citi could also be opening itself up to legal liability, but for now with the ban in constitutional limbo the ramifications are unclear, &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citi-draws-ire-of-texas-republicans-over-its-new-abortion-policy-1.1738714" target="_blank"&gt;lawyers told Bloomberg Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next:&lt;/strong&gt; Later this year, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. If the ban is upheld, observers believe it would topple Roe v. Wade and trigger more bans in other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big question now is whether &lt;/strong&gt;more large companies will step in with policies like Citi’s or make public pronouncements, if Roe is overturned, said Leila Abolfazli, director of reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>U.S. officials say Russian authorities won't let them see detained WNBA star Brittney Griner</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have not seen American basketball star Brittney Griner since she &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russian-customs-detains-american-basketball-brittney-griner-27ec8090-eff6-4e92-94f2-c390caa693ae.html" target="_blank"&gt;was arrested in Moscow&lt;/a&gt; last month on drug charges because Russian authorities have repeatedly denied their requests, a State Department spokesperson told Axios Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: "&lt;/strong&gt;We have repeatedly asked for consular access to these detainees and have consistently been denied access," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; "Russia must abide by its legal obligations and allow us to provide consular services for U.S. citizens detained in Russia," the spokesperson added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The spokesperson said U.S. officials were "closely engaged on this case and in frequent contact with" the legal team of the WNBA player, who's had her &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russian-court-extends-griners-arrest-may-838ba141-6522-41eb-95a8-9a8c8a5b668d.html" target="_blank"&gt;detention extended until May 19&lt;/a&gt;, according to the state-run Tass news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Griner, a double Olympic gold medalist, was detained as relations between Russia and the U.S. deteriorated, on Feb. 17 after Russian Federal Customs Service accused her of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That same day, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/blinken-un-security-council-russia-ukraine-8a968f77-0bd5-4a70-a211-017c3d707973.html" target="_blank"&gt;Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned&lt;/a&gt; in a speech before the United Nations Security Council that the U.S. believed Russia's military would invade Ukraine within days.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;An American citizen killed in a Russian attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv was identified by his family and Ukrainian officials on Thursday as James Whitney Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The 67-year-old Minnesota native, known as Jimmy or Jim, "was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military snipers" on Wednesday, wrote his sister Cheryl Hill Gordon on Facebook. "His body was found in the street by the local police," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USEmbassyKyiv/status/1504074846342418434" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; after the attack, "Russian forces shot and killed 10 people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Antony &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-16/" target="_blank"&gt;Blinken confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a U.S. citizen had been killed in the attack, which Russia's military denied carrying out.

    <title>Moderna asks FDA to authorize additional booster shot for all adults</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Moderna has asked the FDA for an emergency authorization that would allow all adults to receive a second COVID-19 booster, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moderna_tx/status/1504628702818316290" target="_blank"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The request is likely to intensify an ongoing scientific debate over how long protection from the two most-used vaccines in the U.S. lasts in the face of new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The move towards a second booster shot is an attempt to combat waning immunity that occurs several months after a first booster shot, notes &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/15/pfizer-second-booster-shot/" target="_blank"&gt;the Washington Post,&lt;/a&gt; which first reported that Pfizer-BioNTech were seeking an emergency authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Moderna's request is broader than Pfizer and BioNTech's, which &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pfizer-biontech-covid-booster-65-and-older-ae75f23a-9220-459d-ae29-43305c07ba79.html" target="_blank"&gt;sought to authorize a second booster&lt;/a&gt; for people 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play:&lt;/strong&gt; Fourth doses are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/cdc-immunocompromised-covid-fourth-shot-1b47635c-c464-4d29-9832-3d94ea1cecf9.html" target="_self"&gt;already authorized for some&lt;/a&gt; immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;The request "was made to provide flexibility" to healthcare providers, Moderna said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderna president Stephen Hoge previously said that &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/moderna-4th-covid-dose-1627d30b-b5e6-4e16-a078-85fb2ec5bdba.html" target="_blank"&gt;a fourth shot would likely&lt;/a&gt; only be necessary for elderly and immunocompromised people but not for the general public.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Meadows, who previously served as former President Trump's chief of staff, is under investigation for alleged voter fraud, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) confirmed to Axios Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The probe comes after the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-did-mark-meadows-register-to-vote-at-an-address-where-he-did-not-reside" target="_blank"&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; reported that Meadows, also a former U.S. congressman, registered to vote in September 2020 using an address he allegedly never visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;The former property owner told the magazine she rented the mobile home to Meadow's wife for two months but that she spent only a handful of nights there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unnamed former owner alleges that Meadows himself was never at the residence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WRAL News, a local NBC affiliate, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/former-nc-congressman-registered-to-vote-in-home-where-he-purportedly-never-stayed/20175679/" target="_blank"&gt;later reported&lt;/a&gt; that the couple allegedly voted in North Carolina via absentee ballots that year.

    <title>Ukraine sought U.S. help training and arming civilian resistance</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine's top national security official asked earlier this month for the U.S. to go beyond traditional military aid and provide the country with the funding, training and weaponry to support a long-term resistance movement, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21435832-danilovletter" target="_blank"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; obtained by Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Russia's advances on the battlefield have largely stalled, prompting fears of a long, grinding war of attrition. Ukraine is seeking more formal and robust backing for its whole-of-society defense against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest package of $800 million in U.S. military aid includes rifles and pistols for possible civilian use, but the bulk of the weaponry is for official military operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The letter was addressed to national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA director Bill Burns, but Axios could not independently confirm it was received by their agencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An NSC spokesperson told Axios: "We are in regular contact with the Ukrainian government, but have no record of receiving this letter and have not confirmed its authenticity."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context: &lt;/strong&gt;Ukraine's parliament last year &lt;a href="https://coffeeordie.com/ukraine-national-resistance-law/" target="_blank"&gt;codified a plan&lt;/a&gt; to fight back against a potential Russian invasion and occupation with its &lt;a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/glava-derzhavi-pidpisav-zakoni-pro-nacionalnij-sprotiv-i-zbi-69809" target="_blank"&gt;Law on the Fundamentals of National Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. It came into effect Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The law sets out the role of the Territorial Defense Forces, a reserve unit that supports the military, as well as irregular partisan forces and local volunteer formations comprised of civilians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If necessary, the law would "allow for the involvement of the entire population of Ukraine in the protection of their homeland, their land and their families," Maria Mezentseva, a Ukrainian member of Parliament, tells Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The letter was dated March 6 and signed by Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It asked the U.S. "to allocate additional funds for the organization of the resistance movement and voluntary formations of territorial communities throughout Ukraine."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Danilov said Ukraine needs "additional supplies of weapons to defeat the enemy, training materials and training of experienced instructors."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Axios obtained the letter from a reliable source in direct contact with the Zelensky administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Throughout the current crisis, the Biden administration's policies toward arming Ukraine have been &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/24/biden-legal-ukraine-russia-resistance/" target="_blank"&gt;colored by legal concerns&lt;/a&gt; over whether certain actions could make the U.S. a "co-combatant" in the war against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The administration has attempted to walk a careful line by claiming it's providing Ukraine with "defensive" but not "offensive" weapons and "real-time" but not lethal "targeting" intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some advocates for a less cautious approach point to the fact that Biden is now supplying Ukraine with drones, anti-aircraft systems and other sophisticated weaponry to argue the U.S. is clearly involved in the war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That, in turn, means it should do everything short of U.S. troops on the ground to help Ukraine, they say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and equipping&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;guerrilla forces&lt;/strong&gt; in an active war zone, however, would cross a new threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/13/briefing-white-house-nixed-december-plan-to-boost-special-ops-presence-in-ukraine-00016830" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week the White House scrapped a plan in December to send a few hundred additional U.S. special operations troops to Ukraine to "provide military advice and training on unconventional warfare." The fear was it would escalate tensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ezra Cohen, a former top Pentagon official in the Trump administration who specialized in intelligence and special operations, told Axios the president would need to seek congressional authorization to provide weapons to Ukrainian forces not part of the regular military command.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Senate Republicans &lt;a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/risch-putin-is-a-madman_the-nyet-act-must-be-taken-up-and-passed" target="_blank"&gt;have proposed&lt;/a&gt; a $500 million "Ukraine Resistance Fund, which would authorize U.S. assistance to both Ukrainian security forces and "appropriately vetted Ukrainian groups and individuals" involved in defending the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A number of Democrats have expressed support for arming a long-term resistance, though the staunch fight Ukraine has already put up through three weeks of war may ultimately make that unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We have to be cognizant of striking the balance between preparing for next steps and setting in place the framework now, while also not neglecting the conventional fight that's going on as we speak," a Senate aide told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from an NSC spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe

    <title>India undermines effort to isolate Russia</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/india-neutral-russia-invasion-ukraine-6f6c4e91-2c3b-4311-8b16-552dc18edf0d.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;India's refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine and efforts to protect trade with Russia mean one of Washington's most valued strategic partners is actively undercutting its efforts to isolate Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Vladimir Putin's invasion has become a stress test for America's global partnerships. America's treaty allies are all onside, including those outside NATO such as Japan and South Korea. India, for reasons of history and geopolitical pragmatism, is very much not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; India abstained on a series of UN votes condemning the invasion. One such resolution was backed by 141 countries, though a Russian diplomat &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3170099/ukraine-war-what-isolation-more-half-world-population-didnt-back" target="_blank"&gt;contended that&lt;/a&gt; — with China and India both abstaining — the critics represented less than half of the global population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the U.S. and EU have led a global push to isolate Russia economically, India has been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-to-buy-russian-oil-at-discount-amid-ukraine-war-11647446532" target="_blank"&gt;buying up more Russian energy&lt;/a&gt; at a discount. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5ee2d6b-693f-475d-80c6-0036c2657ef1" target="_blank"&gt;per the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;, India's central bank is discussing a rupee-ruble trade plan with Moscow to ensure it can continue to buy Russian goods, potentially weakening the effects of Western sanctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. officials say they understand India's delicate position vis-a-vis Russia, though White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called on India's leaders to "think about where you want to stand when history books are written.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The State Department dispatched and then quickly recalled a cable telling diplomats to warn counterparts from India and the UAE that their abstentions at the UN put them "in Russia's camp," &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/us-accuses-india-uae-russias-camp-8dc60479-e897-454f-8ac4-45aef5c39458.html" target="_blank"&gt;Axios' Hans Nichols reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The British trade secretary &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-very-disappointed-with-indias-stance-ukraine-trade-minister-2022-03-17/" target="_blank"&gt;said Thursday that the U.K. is "very disappointed"&lt;/a&gt; by India's position and hopes it will change. That's not looking likely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Data: United Nations; Map: Danielle Alberti/Axios&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;India's position is informed by decades of cooperation with Russia and the then-Soviet Union, including its disputes with China and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additionally, 70% of India's military arsenal is Russian-made, and New Delhi is counting on Moscow for additional systems and spare parts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying Russian oil and weaponry "is India's way of trying to ensure that Russia keeps India's interests in mind," and doesn't shift toward Pakistan or become entirely beholden to China, says Aparna Pande of the Hudson Institute. That also helps explain the post-invasion silence from New Delhi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But calling for peace without picking sides&lt;/strong&gt; is also India's default approach to global crises, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;India doesn't want other powers to intervene over Kashmir, and is reluctant to use sanctions because it doesn't want to face sanctions itself. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"At its core, Indian foreign policy is very realpolitik," Pande says. For example, "India is a democracy but India doesn't do democracy promotion."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;India coordinates most closely with the U.S. than any other country, Pande adds. But rather than seeking to bind itself to Washington through a formal alliance, its focus is on balancing relations with multiple global powers, including Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom out:&lt;/strong&gt; India isn't alone in hedging its bets over Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saudi Arabia has been snubbing the Biden administration as it seeks to increase oil production. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Israel has condemned the invasion but is also treading lightly to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/israel-russia-coordination-syria-ukraine-war-296343ab-d0bc-4c06-8e33-4e2dcac8601b.html" target="_blank"&gt;protect its security coordination with Russia&lt;/a&gt; in Syria. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, defending his own neutral stance, went so far Thursday as to blame NATO for the "instability" that led to war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; Successive U.S. administrations have made India a centerpiece of their strategies to counter China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But Pande says if China claims territory in the South China Sea or even invades Taiwan, India's response will be much the same as with Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>UN leaders urge the world to not forget about other global crises</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/humanitarian-crisis-afghanistan-yemen-ethiopia-ukraine-d314cdc0-4c4d-4381-8d3d-52ce17f6f0ab.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As countries quickly mobilize to respond to the deepening crisis in Ukraine, UN leaders are urging them to not forget about the ongoing crises in places like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;While the heightened focus on Ukraine is understandable and necessary, advocates say, there's growing concern dire humanitarian crises elsewhere may be neglected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"In a word, developing countries are getting pummeled," UN Secretary-General António Guterres &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/node/262391" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; this week.

Ukraine alone provides more than half of the WFP's wheat supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;"This war goes far beyond Ukraine," Guterres said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It is also an assault on the world’s most vulnerable people and countries," he added. "All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Russian government websites face "unprecedented" level of hacking</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian government websites and state media are facing an "unprecedented" level of hacking attempts, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/17/russia-government-hacking-wave-unprecedented/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wp_homepage" target="_blank"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the start of its &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;unprovoked invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, Russia has passed a new "&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/putin-tests-limits-internet-truth-lockdown-cb45dd16-1b35-4ce7-88c8-8ad46be9e574.html" target="_blank"&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt;" law and blocked &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-blocks-access-to-facebook-11269b1c-06b2-409e-bee0-405a9a45fbe9.html" target="_blank"&gt;social media networks&lt;/a&gt; like Facebook in order to clamp down on the ability of regular Russians to get unfiltered information about the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;"We are recording unprecedented attacks on the websites of government authorities," Russia's Ministry of Digital Development and Communications said in a statement Thursday, per the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hacking attacks have also been significantly more powerful than similar ones in the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"If their capacity at peak times reached 500 GB earlier, it is now up to 1 TB.

They also added a link that offers "full information about the war in Ukraine," per the Post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Why soaring mortgage rates might not cool the housing market</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/mortgage-rates-soar-housing-c7032d5f-5a94-4992-b334-7762199e01cd.html</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;Source: University of Michigan; Chart: Axios Visuals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Federal Reserve ends its era of ultra-easy money, home mortgage rates are rising rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; It may take more than somewhat-higher mortgage rates to cool the blistering hot housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's because wages are rising rapidly, offsetting some of the higher borrowing costs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;Imagine a simple model for how much a typical American family can afford to borrow for a house. In this family, two breadwinners each work 40 hours a week at the average hourly wage for non-supervisory workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are only willing to pay 28% of their pre-tax income on their mortgage, a 30-year fixed rate loan at the average prevailing rate published by Freddie Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this model, our hypothetical family could afford to take out a $537,000 mortgage at the 4.16% cited by Freddie Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's down&lt;/strong&gt; from the $613,000 they could have theoretically borrowed back in August, when mortgage rates were comfortably below 3%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, but, but:&lt;/strong&gt; It's still above the $522,000 they could have afforded to borrow in February 2020 before the pandemic, when average hourly earnings were 12% lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we're watching: &lt;/strong&gt;Do longer-term interest rates — which mortgage rates tend to track — continue their upward drift? Mortgage rates approached 5% as recently as 2018, which was enough to choke off home buying activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/home-builders-housing-market-nahb-wells-fargo-bc6c97cb-def6-4576-b3d6-1ce3639c5cd9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Home builder confidence in housing market is waning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Hispanic activists fight to preserve a Texas school connected to Head Start history</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/wharton-texas-school-latinos-head-start-history-8448eb73-5cb7-4084-b2f6-80b6a1a22d2a.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Activists are rushing to preserve a Texas school that educated Mexican American students during desegregation efforts and later became one of the models for the federal Head Start program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The property that's home to the Stephen F. Austin/Minnie Mae Hopper Elementary School — one of the last remaining &lt;a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/little-school-of-the-400" target="_blank"&gt;"Little Schools of the 400"&lt;/a&gt; — is slated to be redeveloped into a housing complex in Wharton, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback: &lt;/strong&gt;The school was built in the 1930s as part of the New Deal. Its name changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1952, the &lt;a href="https://www.thecountygin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-9.25.25-AM.png" target="_blank"&gt;Saturday Evening Pos&lt;/a&gt;t published a photo showing a Mexican American student sharing a water fountain with a white student in the school, highlighting the region's desegregation wins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Later, the school joined the experimental "Little School of the 400" — a program developed in Texas by restaurateur &lt;a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fti08" target="_blank"&gt;Felix Tijerina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/wel01" target="_blank"&gt;League of United Latin American Citizens&lt;/a&gt; during the 1950s. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project sought to teach Spanish-speaking preschool children 400 basic English words to overcome early language barriers. The idea was a precursor to Head Start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;David C. Bucek, Jr., of SternBucek Architects, said the school's inside has been abandoned for a few years, but it's still essentially watertight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whartonisd.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Wharton Independent School District&lt;/a&gt; sold the property in 2020 to Austin, Texas, developer &lt;a href="https://a2jholdings.com/" target="_blank"&gt;A2J Holdings&lt;/a&gt; for redevelopment using an $8.75 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The company says it wants to build 34 new homes in Wharton, a town in need of housing after Hurricane Harvey struck the region in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I am personally interested in preserving the existing building for adaptive reuse under the terms and budget of the $8.75M grant," David Bowlin, the company's chief operations officer, &lt;a href="https://a2jholdings.com/500-abell-street-faq" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;Local community members, former students, and civil rights advocates &lt;a href="https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/premium/community-members-try-to-save-historic-wharton-school-from-redevelopment/article_ac94deaa-2879-11ec-b927-fb28e81af5c8.html" target="_blank"&gt;have stalled the project &lt;/a&gt;by getting a historic designation and asking state officials to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wharton resident Pat Blair told Axios advocates have formed the nonprofit, Wharton County Heritage Partnership, to save the school and use it for educational purposes instead of housing. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, but, but:&lt;/strong&gt; Bowlin told Axios the school has been saved and he helped ensure that it can never be demolished by getting the building listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I made a formal offer to the Wharton County Heritage Partnership to dedicate an entire 4,000 (square foot) school building on the SFA/Hopper Elementary site for their exclusive use for educational and civic purposes for $1 per year.  The offer was declined by the WCHP," Bowlin said. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intrigue: &lt;/strong&gt;David Vela, who served as acting director of the National Parks Service under former President Donald Trump, was a student at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vela told Axios it's crucial that the school's history is preserved, and he hopes officials stop the housing plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bridget English, a spokeswoman for the Wharton Independent School District, declined to comment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/preserving-history-latino-school-segregation-48dcdd57-71e1-4795-a96e-a5283b370718.html" target="_blank"&gt;Activists in Marfa, Texas,&lt;/a&gt; are working on getting national recognition for a building once used as a segregated school for Mexican American students, some of who were used as extras in the 1956 movie, "Giant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Efforts to preserve the &lt;a href="https://www.theblackwellschool.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Blackwell School &lt;/a&gt;in West Texas are part of a movement to save sites connected to the nation's history of racial segregation and racial terror.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;David Bowlin. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The virtues of slow and steady economic growth</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/slow-steady-economic-growth-0c7e0195-b408-44c3-a00b-06058526a32e.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the 2010s was way too slow. That is the embedded conventional wisdom of economic thinkers across the ideological spectrum, including those with different ideas about how it could have been better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;But the experience of the last year shows that there are also hazards in an expansion that moves too fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Inevitably there will be another recession. When it comes, policymakers will need to wrestle with what was frustrating about both the early 2010s and early 2020s to try to avoid repeating either set of errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback:&lt;/strong&gt; The recession that accompanied the global financial crisis technically ended in mid-2009. Yet per-capita GDP did not reach its pre-recession high until four years later. The unemployment rate didn't reach its pre-recession low until March 2017!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason, in a commonly held narrative, was inadequate fiscal stimulus early on in the recovery, combined with the Federal Reserve's persistently premature withdrawal of monetary stimulus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was this recent history&lt;/strong&gt; that shaped the response of both fiscal and monetary policymakers to the pandemic-induced recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Obama fiscal stimulus passed in early 2009 was $787 billion and enacted at a time the economy was still in free-fall. The funds would turn out to be far short of the "output gap" between the economy's potential and its actual performance over the ensuing years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By contrast, the American Rescue Plan passed one year ago was $1.9 trillion, and came on top of a $900 billion pandemic rescue enacted three months earlier. Those numbers were far above plausible estimates of the 2021 output gap, and came on the heels of multi-trillion dollar legislation to fill the output gap in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; This really has been an extraordinarily rapid recovery in growth and the job market. It took one year to return to pre-recession GDP, not four. The unemployment rate is nearly back to pre-pandemic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But what we're learning the hard way is that when the economy goes into a deep downturn, if you try to turn it back on too quickly, things break.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is the common thread&lt;/strong&gt; among a range of current economic woes, including shortages of workers and physical goods, and high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just maybe, for example, in a more gradual recovery, automakers would have been able to rebuild their capacity along with demand, and there wouldn't be such extreme shortages and price spikes for new and used cars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employers might still be hiring at a rapid clip in this more steady-eddy recovery, but not so rapidly as to outstrip the number of people ready to clock in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public opinion data shows&lt;/strong&gt; the degree of discontent in spite of the rapid recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Gallup polling, 42% of Americans last month (before the invasion of Ukraine) rated economic conditions as poor, about the same as in April 2012 (40%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depending on the exact question&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;asked, &lt;/strong&gt;Americans seem to feel things are worse than they did during the too-slow economy a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One example:&lt;/strong&gt; In April 2010, 49% of Americans said they thought economic conditions were getting better in a &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1609/consumer-views-economy.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the unemployment rate was 9.9% and inflation over the previous 12 months was 2.2%. The economy grew at a 2% rate the preceding quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In February 2022, 26% thought conditions were improving, at a time of 3.8% unemployment and 7.9% inflation. The economy grew at a 7% rate last quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose policymakers had really stepped on the economic policy gas in 2009 and 2010 — an Obama stimulus of $3 trillion, for example, and open-ended quantitative easing from the Fed sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe it would have created a happy-days-are-here-again economic boom. Or maybe it would have generated similar growing pains, inflation, and negative public opinion that we're experiencing now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal of economic policy is to deliver the results that citizens find satisfying. The experience of the last few months suggests that people dislike an economy running too hot as much as they hate it when things run too cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Democrats look to limit gas price fallout</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/democrats-gas-price-fallout-2dc174bd-aeb7-4483-b413-361157f4956b.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The White House&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and top Capitol Hill Democrats are scurrying to limit the political damage from &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/gas-prices-biden-russia-ukraine-42f3aa55-dce0-4ae6-8133-b6c5e02f63d1.html" target="_blank"&gt;high gasoline prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to haul Big Oil CEOs before Congress to explain the "bewildering incongruity" between pump costs and the recent crude oil price decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It "smacks of price gouging," Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. That was not long after President Biden &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1504073842871963653" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that gasoline prices should be lower, based on the oil price. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans," Biden said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest:&lt;/strong&gt; House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, late in the afternoon, invited CEOs of oil majors like Exxon and large independents to testify on April 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The announcement accuses the industry of exploiting the Ukraine crisis and market shocks to "keep prices artificially high and increase their own profits."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;Several analysts and economists said the crude-pump price discrepancy simply reflects the time it takes oil price changes to filter through the refined product market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, Jason Bordoff, an Obama-era White House energy and climate aide, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonBordoff/status/1504114424784773125" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; this in response to Biden's comment: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There's a long economics literature explaining 'rockets &amp;amp; feathers' — why gasoline prices go up faster when oil price rises than they fall when oil price drops."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapidan Energy Group President Bob McNally, an energy aide in the George W. Bush White House, made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_McNally/status/1504080523626528782" target="_blank"&gt;similar point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;These and other recent allegations of oil companies taking advantage of consumers come as gasoline prices are at record levels (though not if you adjust for inflation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's probably a political liability for Democrats heading into the midterm elections, even though presidents have very little near-term sway over gasoline prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also spilling into climate policy debates. Republicans and industry groups are calling for the White House to back off efforts to curb federal leasing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Crude oil prices have come down a lot over the last week or so. WTI, the U.S. benchmark, fell into the $94-per-barrel range earlier this week after going to about $130-per-barrel earlier in the month. (It regained some ground to about $100 Thursday morning.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gasoline prices have fallen less quickly. Thursday morning, per AAA, the nationwide average is $4.29-per-gallon, compared to $4.32 a week ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next: &lt;/strong&gt;This morning PunchBowl News reported that House Democratic leaders are in preliminary talks with rank-and-file members about ideas for lowering prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's a "recognition that sky-high prices at the pump could be a massive political problem this fall," it notes. Members are batting around ideas including a gas tax holiday and direct consumer rebates, it reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;President Biden will speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday as "part of our ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication between the United States and the PRC," press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Biden and Xi will in part discuss Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine after reports indicated that &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;Moscow had asked China's government&lt;/a&gt; for military ​equipment and other assistance to support its war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chinese officials said they were unaware of any request from Russian officials, though U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/china-ukraine-proxy-war-arm-russia-86a101ed-04e2-4d0a-bce5-b25dd79022ff.html" target="_blank"&gt;this week warned&lt;/a&gt; China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi of "consequences" if Beijing materially supports the war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The U.S. has also accused &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/linda-thomas-greenfield-denounces-russian-biological-weapons-claims-fa334f73-3466-4c21-8167-d819df5f7969.html" target="_blank"&gt;China of assisting Russia&lt;/a&gt; in spreading false claims that the United States is financing biological weapons labs in Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "The two Leaders will discuss managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia’s war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern," Psaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi have forged &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/china-russia-ukraine-invasion-position-8c67a99d-ce83-493d-aa41-dda7f0c60593.html" target="_blank"&gt;deeper economic and military ties&lt;/a&gt; over the past several years as tensions with the U.S. have soared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With Russia facing &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-most-sanctioned-country-0de10d02-51aa-46c4-9711-bb45303fdfb8.html" target="_blank"&gt;overwhelming economic sanctions&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. and Europe, Moscow will likely have to deepen its already significant economic reliance on Beijing — though it's an increasingly lopsided relationship, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-sanctions-china-economy-9957caed-21be-4fb6-ac60-c4ff50ea44c0.html" target="_blank"&gt;Axios' Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian and Dave Lawler report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/europe-skepticism-toward-china-grows-3ef65fe3-d0dd-4b26-8fbc-e1a10f3104ae.html" target="_blank"&gt;Europe's skepticism toward China grows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Jeff Zients to step down as Biden's COVID response coordinator</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Zients is set to leave his position as the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator in April, President Biden announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;Zients will be replaced by Ashish Jha, who currently serves as dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Biden called Jha "one of the leading public health experts in America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zients' deputy, Natalie Quillian, will also depart from the COVID response team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/jeffrey-zients-ashish-jha.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; first reported the story.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What he's saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"I called on Jeff Zients to lead my Administration’s COVID-19 response because there is no one better at delivering results than Jeff," Biden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Jeff spent the last 14 months working tirelessly to help combat COVID.  He is a man of service and an expert manager. I will miss his counsel and I’m grateful for his service."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biden credited Zients with orchestrating the White House's handling of the virus, suggesting he was responsible for 80% of adults being fully vaccinated, for keeping schools open, and for the "hundreds of millions" of at-home tests that have been distributed to the American people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden said Jha&lt;/strong&gt;, Zients' successor, is known for his "wise and calming public presence," adding that "as we enter a new moment in the pandemic — executing on my National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and managing the ongoing risks from COVID — Dr. Jha is the perfect person for the job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jha, a practicing physician with expertise in infectious diseases&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;said he is "honored to accept" Biden's invitation to serve as COVID-19 response coordinator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Zients had planned to work as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;COVID-19 response coordinator for only a limited time but kept extending his stay at Biden's request, the Times notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Zients joined the White House COVID-19 response team in January 2021, succeeding Deborah Birx, who held the position under the Trump White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior to his work on the COVID team, he served as director of the National Economic Council, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and led the team that fixed HealthCare.gov website during the Obama administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story has been updated with Ashish Jha's statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Avalanche of uncertainty drives markets to breaking point</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Russian stock market is shuttered. Gasoline prices are soaring, yet the U.S. won't buy cheap Russian oil. The market for nickel stopped trading for a week, tried to restart, then stopped almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Sanctions, government actions and remarkable price moves are rocking our once-unshakable reliance on rational markets as a pillar of the world economy.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest: &lt;/strong&gt;The 145-year-old London Metal Exchange (LME) reopened trading in nickel yesterday after a weeklong freeze — only to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/lme-resume-nickel-trading-1400-gmt-mulls-wider-price-limit-2022-03-16/" target="_blank"&gt;slam the market shut again&lt;/a&gt; within minutes due to a technical problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; The initial nickel market shutdown followed an extraordinary short squeeze that sent prices up over 250% in a little more than 24 hours, culminating on March 8, when they climbed above $100,000 per metric tonne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The seismic move triggered a cascade of margin calls that would have likely bankrupted major players in the market — and perhaps the exchange itself, though officials there deny it — had the LME not said, basically, "oh, well nevermind," and canceled the offending trades.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloomberg has a great blow-by-blow of the chaos &lt;a href="https://www.mining.com/web/the-18-minutes-of-trading-chaos-that-broke-the-nickel-market/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people who, presumably, would have made some decent scratch on those trades, are not pleased. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:  "&lt;/strong&gt;For the LME to cancel nickel trades between willing buyers and sellers is unforgiveable. UNFORGIVEABLE.," wrote Mark Thompson, a metals trader, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/METhompson72/status/1502245675622408195?s=20&amp;amp;t=qEL2Onalv5yt74SDsm8psg" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;For decades following the fall of communism, the global economy was organized around the idea that financial markets were reliable and accurate mechanisms for measuring and managing the universe of risks facing companies, investors and the world.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These ideas were rooted, in part, in the so-called &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C33&amp;amp;q=efficient+market+hypothesis&amp;amp;oq=Efficient+mar" target="_blank"&gt;efficient market hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;,  the quasi-mystical — but incredibly influential — idea that market prices fully and correctly reflect "all known information."  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people then made the leap that the market in some sense always identifies prices that are "correct.”  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others however, argued&lt;/strong&gt; that markets can't incorporate all known information —  because sometimes people with good info can't participate. This idea is known as "&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C33&amp;amp;q=Limits+to+arbitrage" target="_blank"&gt;limits to arbitrage&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The financial world is now confronting some serious limits to arbitrage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt's thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm no hedge fund genius but it seems like a pretty good bet that Russian stocks will probably fall, since the West has hammered the country economically with sanctions. Some people probably want to short the Russian market! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, they can't. Such bets on falling stock prices &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news/card/russia-central-bank-bans-short-selling-as-stocks-plunge-SjQFvNNXoXUKE4lkESfe" target="_blank"&gt;were banned&lt;/a&gt; in Russia almost as soon as the tanks started to rumble toward Kyiv. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And in case that was enough, the entire market was shuttered soon after the short-selling ban. The Russian market has been closed since Feb. 25.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, well, how about Russian oil?&lt;/strong&gt; It's obviously undervalued, since it's trading for  an unprecedented $30 discount to other global oil benchmarks. Buying it seems like a good trade! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Except that sanctions mean there's no reputable U.S. broker who would let anyone make such a trade. (And that, by the way, is why it's cheap.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where it stands: &lt;/strong&gt;When the London Metal Exchange reopened trading in nickel yesterday morning, there were clearly plenty of people who thought that the insanely high nickel prices couldn't last. And they wanted to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a result, prices plunged so fast that some trades exceeded the new 5% limit on daily price changes that the exchange had imposed — forcing it to suspend trading for a time once again. (You could, however, execute trades in that bastion of market freedom, Communist China, at the Shanghai Futures Exchange.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The LME was finally able to reopen trading at roughly 2 p.m. yesterday, but had to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/nickel-falls-8percent-to-hit-limit-down-in-chaotic-trade-on-london-metal-exchange.html" target="_blank"&gt;halt again&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Markets are human institutions. When events get as crazy as they are now, the illusion of markets as a completely separate system from either grand geopolitics or the more mundane politics of any institution — like a metals exchange — suddenly disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during his virtual address to the Bundestag on Thursday, accused Germany of putting its economic interests ahead of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, telling the lawmakers their support "came too late to stop war," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60774819?ns_mchannel=social&amp;amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;amp;ns_linkname=6232f85d980bea49f4b7ce5b%26Help+came+too+late%2C+Zelensky+tells+German+politicians%262022-03-17T09%3A07%3A57.106Z&amp;amp;ns_fee=0&amp;amp;pinned_post_locator=urn%3Aasset%3A92d42354-e8f0-43ba-bda3-2d0deb85cf75&amp;amp;pinned_post_asset_id=6232f85d980bea49f4b7ce5b&amp;amp;pinned_post_type=share" target="_blank"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian petroleum products and imports in general, was hesitant to raise harsh sanctions on Russia for fear it could hurt the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far, Germany has not banned Russian oil and gas imports but Chancellor Olaf Scholz did cancel the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/germany-nord-stream-2-russia-ukraine-dabaa58c-6855-4b5a-b4b0-15648a019cfc.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nord Stream 2&lt;/a&gt; natural gas pipeline, which was opposed by Ukraine and others because they believed it would damage European security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Germany also reversed its restrictive European arms export policy in response to Russia's invasion by &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/germany-weapons-ukraine-russia-156e24ad-b591-421e-9c22-105118adc377.html" target="_blank"&gt;supplying Ukrainian forces&lt;/a&gt; with anti-tank and air-defense weapons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "We could see your willingness to continue to do business with Russia and now we're in the middle of the ... war," Zelensky told German lawmakers, referring to the country's business interests in Russia before the invasion, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"And again this is something you have failed to see.

Now that there's so much competition, it's a bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Netflix on Wednesday &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/paying-to-share-netflix-outside-your-household" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it will start testing ways to enable subscribers who share passwords outside of their households to do so "while also paying a bit more." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will test two new features in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru that allow households to add an extra member for up to two people they don’t live with at a cost or allow any shared Netflix plan users to transfer their shared profile information and data either to a new account or an extra member sub account.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart: &lt;/strong&gt;Netflix is under pressure to increase its margins and grow its memberships, following a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/netflix-stock-growth-slump-ec0e9055-596b-467b-83f7-19fb592cbe31.html" target="_blank"&gt;subscription slowdown&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last year and weak guidance for the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tech giant said Wednesday that password sharing impacts its "ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback: &lt;/strong&gt;Last March, Netflix tested showing users pop-ups asking them to verify their account with an email or text code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HBO Max only lets up to three profiles within the same account stream at the same time. Hulu with Live TV forces &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/unlimited-screens#:~:text=Add%20Unlimited%20Screens%20to%20your,to%20three%20separate%20mobile%20devices." target="_blank"&gt;users to pay&lt;/a&gt; to stream from the same account via more than two devices at the same time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;More than one-third of Americans (36%) share their Netflix account passwords with relatives, according to a new study by The Advertising Research Foundation, while 13% share them with friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer Americans share their Amazon Prime passwords with relatives (22%) and friends (8%), likely because they are are tied to retail account information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To no surprise, the study also found that larger households tend to have more co-viewing. Among subscription streaming services, Disney+, followed by Netflix and Amazon, has the most co-viewing activity among households, likely due to the family-friendly nature of its programming. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart:&lt;/strong&gt; Many streamers assume a set of devices belong to the same household as long as they connect through the same IP address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That assumption doesn't address co-viewing (people watching content at the same time via the same device), nor does it account for families using different devices via different IP addresses. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; One way streamers are able to reduce monthly churn is by partnering with telecom providers to offer their services via TV or phone plans that are typically harder to cancel. Disney+ debuted with a distribution plan with Verizon. Netflix has a distribution deal with T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/streamings-cancel-culture-problem-d64333b1-76dc-424d-926f-483c334d08af.html" target="_blank"&gt;Streaming's cancel culture problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Face recognition's staying power</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/facial-recognition-staying-power-government-irs-10701d9f-3553-43c2-a55e-d064625c1970.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;U.S. adoption of facial recognition software hit a speed bump recently when the Internal Revenue Service dropped one controversial plan, but public and private institutions are charging ahead with deploying the technology anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Facial recognition systems solve thorny identification problems for government agencies and businesses, but they also raise concerns over bias and privacy, particularly since the U.S. lacks strong data regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite the concerns, government use of facial recognition continues to grow in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twenty-seven U.S. states already use ID.me's services to assist with verifying identification for unemployment benefits and other services. And this month, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/the-irs-dropped-id-mes-facial-recognition-tech-after-backlash-wa-is-rolling-it-out-in-june/" target="_blank"&gt;Washington state said&lt;/a&gt; it would start using ID.me in June.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;War-torn Ukraine has started using controversial company Clearview AI's facial recognition services to "[let] authorities potentially vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses," &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-ukraine-has-started-using-clearview-ais-facial-recognition-during-war-2022-03-13/?utm_campaign=wp_the_technology_202&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_technology202" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catch up quick: &lt;/strong&gt;Last month, the IRS &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/irs-virtual-interview-authentication-a3412436-d0f4-41d3-b85b-eaa49ccbee07.html" target="_blank"&gt;backtracked from its plan&lt;/a&gt; to require taxpayers to verify their identities using ID.me to obtain some services. The agency will allow people to do live, virtual interviews with agents instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The original IRS plan &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/irs-face-recognition-hackles-id-me-0235a30d-8066-4664-82b2-383313bd1962.html" target="_blank"&gt;sparked outrage&lt;/a&gt; from privacy advocates and resurfaced &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ai-bias-facial-recognition-race-ed497895-4570-451b-b7d0-9ad7d2d4a2c8.html" target="_blank"&gt;longstanding concerns about racial and economic bias&lt;/a&gt; in facial recognition software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying&lt;/strong&gt;: Regulators and civil liberties groups have pushed hard against the use of ID.me software in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There is no way that facial recognition or other tools that collect biometric data can be used in a safe manner. We liken it to nuclear weapons — too dangerous and shouldn't be used at all," Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at Fight for the Future, told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"What we saw with the IRS using facial recognition is a sign of things to come. The backlash was swift and very clear that it is not a tool that should be used by our government," she said. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-brown-and-warren-urge-labor-department-to-help-state-unemployment-insurance-programs-transition-away-from-private-facial-recognition-contractors" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to the Labor Department last month urging the agency to help state unemployment insurance programs move away from private facial recognition contractors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"States are rightfully looking for solutions to protect against fraud and identity theft. But no one should be forced to submit to facial recognition administered by a private company just to access essential government services," Wyden told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intrigue: &lt;/strong&gt;Facial recognition can solve many problems for organizations that need to verify a person's identity, particularly given the obstacles raised during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For instance, Washington state briefly &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-halts-unemployment-payments-for-two-days-after-finding-1-6-million-in-fraudulent-claims-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank"&gt;stopped unemployment benefits&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, after finding fraudulent claims made with stolen Social Security numbers and other personal data that totaled $1.6 million, according to the Seattle Times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-288.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; recommended that several federal agencies discontinue "knowledge-based verification," which relies on a user's knowing and presenting personal information (like answers to security questions) to prove their identity. The GOA said this verification "tends to be error-prone and can be frustrating for users, given the limitations of human memory."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Facial recognition's deployment in everyday consumer devices, like iPhone's Face ID, has accustomed much of the public to its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/09/05/more-than-half-of-u-s-adults-trust-law-enforcement-to-use-facial-recognition-responsibly/" target="_blank"&gt;A Pew survey&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 showed that a majority of U.S. respondents trusted law enforcement to use facial recognition responsibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facial recognition is "used a lot of different ways, and some are really creepy and concerning, and some are really benign... And in some cases, in the U.S., it's been used pretty safely and effectively," said Jeremy Grant, managing director of technology business strategy at law firm Venable LLP, who consults with identity verification businesses.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;The highest-profile face-recognition providers have spurred barrages of criticism for failing to play straight with the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"A lack of transparency erodes public trust," Jordan Burris, former chief of staff in the White House's Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, told Axios.  Burris is now senior director of product market strategy at Socure, a digital identity verification provider that serves the public and private sector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Regardless of the tech used, there needs to be a focus on deep testing, security, privacy of the consumer, mitigating bias and getting the outcomes intended by the government," he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality check: &lt;/strong&gt;Even if facial recognition tools provoked a broader groundswell, businesses have already made a massive data harvest over the last decade and built lasting databases of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clearview AI told investors last month that "almost everyone in the world will be identifiable" after it collects its targeted 100 billion facial photos, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/16/clearview-expansion-facial-recognition/" target="_blank"&gt;the Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last year, TikTok updated &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;its terms of service&lt;/a&gt; to say the popular app will automatically collect "faceprints and voiceprints" without details on how they will be used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

The agency will allow people to do live, virtual interviews with agents instead.</p><ul><li>The original IRS plan <a href="https://www.axios.com/irs-face-recognition-hackles-id-me-0235a30d-8066-4664-82b2-383313bd1962.html" target="_blank">sparked outrage</a> from privacy advocates and resurfaced<a href="https://www.axios.com/ai-bias-facial-recognition-race-ed497895-4570-451b-b7d0-9ad7d2d4a2c8.html" target="_blank">longstanding concerns about racial and economic bias</a> in facial recognition software.</li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying</strong>: Regulators and civil liberties groups have pushed hard against the use of ID.me software in particular.</p><ul><li>"There is no way that facial recognition or other tools that collect biometric data can be used in a safe manner. We liken it to nuclear weapons — too dangerous and shouldn't be used at all," Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at Fight for the Future, told Axios.</li><li>"What we saw with the IRS using facial recognition is a sign of things to come. The backlash was swift and very clear that it is not a tool that should be used by our government," she said. </li><li>Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-brown-and-warren-urge-labor-department-to-help-state-unemployment-insurance-programs-transition-away-from-private-facial-recognition-contractors" target="_blank">wrote</a> to the Labor Department last month urging the agency to help state unemployment insurance programs move away from private facial recognition contractors.</li><li>"States are rightfully looking for solutions to protect against fraud and identity theft. But no one should be forced to submit to facial recognition administered by a private company just to access essential government services," Wyden told Axios.</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>Facial recognition can solve many problems for organizations that need to verify a person's identity, particularly given the obstacles raised during the pandemic.</p><ul><li>For instance, Washington state briefly <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-halts-unemployment-payments-for-two-days-after-finding-1-6-million-in-fraudulent-claims-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank">stopped unemployment benefits</a> in 2020, after finding fraudulent claims made with stolen Social Security numbers and other personal data that totaled $1.6 million, according to the Seattle Times.</li><li>In 2019, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-288.pdf" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> recommended that several federal agencies discontinue "knowledge-based verification," which relies on a user's knowing and presenting personal information (like answers to security questions) to prove their identity. The GOA said this verification "tends to be error-prone and can be frustrating for users, given the limitations of human memory."</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Facial recognition's deployment in everyday consumer devices, like iPhone's Face ID, has accustomed much of the public to its use.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/09/05/more-than-half-of-u-s-adults-trust-law-enforcement-to-use-facial-recognition-responsibly/" target="_blank">A Pew survey</a> from 2019 showed that a majority of U.S. respondents trusted law enforcement to use facial recognition responsibly.</li><li>Facial recognition is "used a lot of different ways, and some are really creepy and concerning, and some are really benign... And in some cases, in the U.S., it's been used pretty safely and effectively," said Jeremy Grant, managing director of technology business strategy at law firm Venable LLP, who consults with identity verification businesses.<strong> </strong></li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>The highest-profile face-recognition providers have spurred barrages of criticism for failing to play straight with the public.</p><ul><li>"A lack of transparency erodes public trust," Jordan Burris, former chief of staff in the White House's Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, told Axios.  Burris is now senior director of product market strategy at Socure, a digital identity verification provider that serves the public and private sector.</li><li>"Regardless of the tech used, there needs to be a focus on deep testing, security, privacy of the consumer, mitigating bias and getting the outcomes intended by the government," he said.</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>Even if facial recognition tools provoked a broader groundswell, businesses have already made a massive data harvest over the last decade and built lasting databases of personal information.</p><ul><li>Clearview AI told investors last month that "almost everyone in the world will be identifiable" after it collects its targeted 100 billion facial photos, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/16/clearview-expansion-facial-recognition/" target="_blank">the Washington Post reported</a>.</li><li>Last year, TikTok updated <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-us?lang=en" target="_blank">its terms of service</a> to say the popular app will automatically collect "faceprints and voiceprints" without details on how they will be used.</li></ul>]]>

    <title>Biden officials fear "mass migration event" if COVID border policies end</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence officials are privately bracing for a massive influx of more than 170,000 migrants at the Mexico border if COVID-era policies &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/migrants-title-42-biden-admin-expulsions-appeals-court-a584913d-8404-45ba-a06d-865a939d19c4.html" target="_blank"&gt;that allow instant expulsions&lt;/a&gt; during the public health emergency are ended, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions tell Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The response under way&lt;/strong&gt; includes a newly created — and previously unreported &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;Southwest Border Coordination Center (SBCC), essentially a war room to coordinate an interagency response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Border officials have used Title 42 more than 1 million times to rapidly expel migrants at the southern border without hearing asylum claims. But the Trump-era order wasn't set up to be permanent, and senior Biden officials are preparing for its end as the virus is brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Department of Homeland Security intelligence estimates that perhaps 25,000 migrants already are waiting in Mexican shelters just south of the border for Title 42 to end. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday, DHS Deputy Secretary John Tien asked employees "to consider stepping forward to support the DHS Volunteer Force," citing large numbers of migrants at the southwest border, according to an email seen by Axios. The email seeks general support for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and help with data entry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sources spoke to Axios on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they’re saying: &lt;/strong&gt;White House spokesperson Vedant Patel did not confirm or dispute specifics of Axios’ reporting but said in a statement, “Of course the Administration is doing our due diligence to prepare for potential changes at the border.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"That is good government in action,” the statement said. “As always is the case this Administration is working every day to provide relief to immigrants, restore order, fairness, and humanity to our immigration system and bring it into the 21st century.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind the scenes: &lt;/strong&gt;Internal discussions have raised alarms that human trafficking networks throughout Mexico and Central America will exploit the situation to "generate a mass migration event." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Biden officials representing multiple agencies &lt;/strong&gt;have been meeting to discuss a whole-of-government plan to deal with the potentially record-breaking spring influx of migrants.  DHS has branded it the Southwest Border Mass Irregular Migration Contingency Plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan is sweeping, &lt;/strong&gt;reflecting how serious the Biden administration believes the situation could soon become, worsening a border surge that has troubled it from the beginning. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;The SBCC will physically operate out of the DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeth's in the case of a border emergency and will be led by Border Patrol's Matthew Hudak, according to two sources familiar with the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although SBCC members have not been finalized yet, DHS is asking for senior officials to support the center from relevant agencies such as the departments of State, Justice, Defense and Health and Human Services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, DHS's modeling would trigger some extreme measures, many of which have been taken during past border surges such as in 2021 and 2019.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The department could surge &lt;/strong&gt;hundreds or thousands of additional personnel from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, Citizenship and Immigration Services and medical personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DHS could request aircraft from the U.S. Marshals Service to help transfer migrants to other areas of the border, and call on additional air and ground transportation from the Department of Defense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officials could also request dozens of buses from the Bureau of Prisons to transport migrants between DHS facilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And they anticipate having to expand and even build new soft-sided facilities that can shelter up to 2,000 migrants apiece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Border resources are already strained with unusually high numbers of people attempting to cross every month &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters" target="_blank"&gt;for a year straight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officials expect those numbers to climb even higher in coming months due both to seasonal trends and the expected end of Title 42.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The backstory: &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC's Title 42 order, first issued under&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;then-President Donald&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump in March of 2020, uses the pandemic as a reason for expelling migrants attempting to enter the U.S. — without the chance to seek asylum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite outcry from progressive Democrats and immigration advocates, the Biden administration has continued to rely on the policy to turn back migrant families and single adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, the Biden administration has attempted to end Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy, which forced migrants into dangerous situations by making them wait for asylum hearings in Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The government's seeming self-contradiction in simultaneously defending Title 42 — which has also forced migrants back to Mexico  — was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-border-policy/2022/01/19/8b75ccf2-7932-11ec-83e1-eaef0fe4b8c9_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;raised in court&lt;/a&gt; by D.C. Circuit Judge Justin Walker in a unanimous decision &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/immigration-border-migrants-title-42-1ffa7503-d0a0-4740-ad23-e103cd8e2284.html" target="_blank"&gt;blocking the U.S. from expelling&lt;/a&gt; migrant families to countries where they may face persecution or torture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;Reuters recently reported that the administration&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-leaning-toward-ending-covid-era-expulsions-migrants-mexico-border-sources-2022-03-09/" target="_blank"&gt; is leaning toward ending Title 42 itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CDC was recently forced by courts to again end the use of Title 42 for unaccompanied minors, and the order notes "CDC anticipates additional lifting of restrictions" as DHS becomes increasingly able to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CDC reassesses Title 42 every 60 days. The next deadline for renewal is in early April. "We continue to defer to the CDC on the use of Title 42 and how long it might remain in effect," a White House official told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"As it stands right now — there are no changes: Title 42 is still in effect and anyone attempting to enter the country unlawfully will be subject to border restrictions — including potentially expulsion," the official added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to preparations on the U.S. side &lt;/strong&gt;of the border, officials are planning how to coordinate with Mexico and other Latin American nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/biden-border-plans-title-42" target="_blank"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on DHS planning to discuss  with Mexico Title 42 ending as soon as April, and what that could mean for migration flows. DHS Secretary Mayorkas visited Mexico this week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue of immigration has plagued&lt;/strong&gt; President Biden since he took office, opening him up to criticism from both the right and the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Democrats have been most &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StefWKight/status/1502000165980360705?s=20&amp;amp;t=-aON1rHkOCmmKlBKFLWHZw" target="_blank"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; over the continued use of Title 42, which they see as a cruel Trump-era policy. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/bidens-immigration-tightrope-3c358702-5aae-41a9-9d25-44081b06914c.html" target="_blank"&gt;Immigration advocates have been outraged&lt;/a&gt; over the low numbers for refugee admissions and the reimplementation of "Remain in Mexico" as ordered by a federal court.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile Republicans have pointed to record numbers at the border and reports of migrants being released into the U.S. by overwhelmed officials, saying Biden is creating "open borders." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;After declining in January, the number of encounters with migrants at the border ticked up in February to 165,000, according to new data released on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the number is well below last year's peak of nearly 214,000 encounters in July, it is higher than last February's, which initially sparked concerns of a border crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Border patrol &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/border-patrol-migrant-arrest-biden-dhs-927fff54-7dfe-48d5-b14f-6dee57f17ec8.html" target="_blank"&gt;arrests reached an all-time high&lt;/a&gt; in fiscal year 2021 at nearly 1.7 million. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Officials are projecting similar numbers for this fiscal year with the end of Title  42, according to sources familiar with the estimates. And some are concerned that reports of migrants being released into the U.S. in lieu of Title 42 could further encourage migration. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/bidens-immigration-tightrope-3c358702-5aae-41a9-9d25-44081b06914c.html" target="_blank"&gt;Migrant advocates fed up as Biden continues controversial Trump practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>COVID boosters' short effectiveness window brings skepticism about 4th shot</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vaccine-booster-pfizer-fauci-fda-3f384209-d216-423a-84f3-36b309718420.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says that at least some Americans will soon need a fourth shot of its &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-latest-news-quick-highlights-57a186a3-7547-45bf-852a-83019849d8d5.html" target="_blank"&gt;coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that, if true, that may raise questions about the utility of the vaccine in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The catch: &lt;/strong&gt;Regulators want to see more data before they're convinced another booster is necessary. If the data &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; show the third shot's ability to ward off severe disease drops after a few months, that may suggest Americans need a better booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Pfizer &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-us-emergency-use-authorization" target="_blank"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it will submit a request to the FDA for a fourth dose of its COVID vaccine to be authorized for people 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/albert-bourla-face-the-nation-full-transcript-03-13-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;interview on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; with CBS' "Face the Nation," however, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla didn't specify which age groups he thinks will need a fourth shot — which raised plenty of eyebrows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We know that the duration of the protection doesn't last very long," Bourla said. "It is necessary, a fourth booster right now."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He added that protection from the third shot is "quite good" against hospitalizations and deaths, but "not that good" against infections, and that protection against infection fades relatively quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;"Pfizer seems to be saying that, because their vaccine isn’t very good, people need more of it. If FDA approves another dose it would make sense to use a stronger vaccine instead, like Moderna or eventually Novavax," said Cornell virologist John Moore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He added that giving seniors another dose is easier to justify than authorizing additional shots for the entire population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;Officials will be paying close attention to effectiveness against hospitalization over time, NIAID director Anthony Fauci said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even when it comes to the common cold, "the population tends to get reinfected with the same coronavirus time after time. As a family of viruses, they don’t seem to induce very durable protection,” Fauci said.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“We obviously need to continue to work on the durability of protection, either by a boosting regimen…and/or perhaps using different platforms of vaccines that give a greater durability," Fauci added. "These are all things that are just under consideration."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We’re continuing to collect&lt;/strong&gt; and assess all available data both from our additional booster studies we started in January 2022 as well as real world evidence as it becomes available," Pfizer said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We’re in continuous, open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a COVID-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The debate over a fourth dose is at its outset plagued by a familiar question: Is the point of the COVID vaccines to prevent infections, or to keep people alive and out of the hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's limited data on how well booster shots hold up against severe disease over time, but the best data so far suggest that protection remains at pretty high levels — 78% against hospitalizations, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm#:~:text=During%20the%20Omicron%2Dpredominant%20period%2C%20mRNA%20vaccination%20was%20highly%20effective,ED%2FUC%20encounters%20by%20the" target="_blank"&gt;per the CDC&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1058464/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-9.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;around four months&lt;/a&gt; after receiving the shot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That means it's still unclear how much anyone stands to gain by getting a fourth shot (outside of the immunocompromised, who are already authorized to get one).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;There's plenty of emerging data that suggest protection against infection wanes pretty quickly after the third shot, and that Pfizer loses its effectiveness faster than Moderna. Experts say this is typical with vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some experts think waning may have been accelerated by the Omicron variant, which the vaccine wasn't made to target. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The virus has evolved profoundly, and you can only ask so much of a vaccine," said Scripps Research's Eric Topol. "The durability isn’t great, but at least we get it back up there to the highest level with a boost.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we're watching: &lt;/strong&gt;Bourla told "Face the Nation" last weekend that Pfizer is trying to create a longer-lasting vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"What we are trying to do, and we are working very diligently right now, it is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including Omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year," he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderna is also tweaking its existing vaccine in order to provide &lt;a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/745959723/files/doc_presentations/program-detail/2022/02/COVID-19-Vaccine-%2802-24-22%29.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;longer-lasting protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Administering booster shots every six months or so isn't a great long-term public health strategy, particularly if it's done with the goal of preventing mild illnesses, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Neither natural infection or immunization is going to protect against mild illness for a long period of time," said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "We're going to have to convince people at some point ... that protection against mild illness is not a reasonable goal."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Russian forces bombed Mariupol theater serving as refuge for hundreds, city council says</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The fate of hundreds of Ukrainians who were sheltering in a Mariupol theater bombed by Russian forces was still unknown, President Volodymyr &lt;a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/svit-povinen-oficijno-viznati-sho-rosiya-stala-derzhavoyu-te-73613" target="_blank"&gt;Zelensky said&lt;/a&gt; in a televised address late Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest: &lt;/strong&gt;Over 1,000 people were believed to have taken refuge in the shelter when it was hit earlier Wednesday, the Mariupol City Council said on &lt;a href="https://t.me/s/mariupolrada" target="_blank"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;. An official in the city's mayor's office &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-city-mariupol-searches-survivors-says-theatre-bomb-shelter-held-2022-03-17/" target="_blank"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that the shelter under withstood the strike and said there are survivors still trapped in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.axios.com/hckFu6Vg6MgqIBI3NzXWnheVuAw=/2022/03/17/1647501056745.jpg"&gt; &lt;div&gt;Multispectral imagery view of fires burning in a residential area of Mariupol on March 14.

To our Mariupol.

"We will never forgive and never forget."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russia's Defense Ministry denied bombing the theater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The invasion has killed at least 691 civilians, &lt;a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-13-march-2022-enruuk" target="_blank"&gt;according to the UN.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zelensky &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-congress-address-ba4fb223-7df5-47ed-aa3b-097c21cb1eae.html" target="_blank"&gt;is urging the U.S. to do more&lt;/a&gt; to help his country fight Russia's invasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper ...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dashboard: Russian invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This article has been updated with comment from Zelensky, Mariupol officials, Russia's Defense Ministry and Maxar Technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court on Wednesday lifted a ban that &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/judge-block-social-cost-carbon-biden-a3e86ebf-888b-4e22-a4f1-76fc11163ce2.html" target="_blank"&gt;blocked a Biden administration policy&lt;/a&gt; of calculating climate change costs in government decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The court's stay in a lawsuit brought by several Republican-led states means that, for now, federal officials can factor in the economic cost of climate change in projects and rulemakings — which could help the Biden administration reach its goal of &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-carbon-goal-4819aad9-3263-4d16-b2ec-b741c7bae15c.html" target="_blank"&gt;cutting greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; by up to 52% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Federal officials said the earlier ruling, by a Trump-appointed U.S. District Court judge in Louisiana, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-carbon-ruling-environment-interior-department-00322ceb-6176-4745-817f-fefc85f57910.html" target="_blank"&gt;had delayed drilling permits&lt;/a&gt;, lease sales and environmental rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context: &lt;/strong&gt;The social cost of carbon is a dollar estimate of the damages caused by emitting one additional metric ton of greenhouse gases into the air, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/authors/afreedman/" target="_blank"&gt;Axios' Andrew Freedman writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It provides policymakers with a way of incorporating future climate damage into present-day decision-making, affecting cost/benefit analyses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Biden administration had &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/02/26/a-return-to-science-evidence-based-estimates-of-the-benefits-of-reducing-climate-pollution/" target="_blank"&gt;implemented the metric applied&lt;/a&gt; during the Obama administration, which was $51 per metric ton. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;The GOP-led states argue in their lawsuit that President Biden didn't have the authority to make such changes — something the three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' rejected Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "The Plaintiff States' claimed injury is 'increased regulatory burdens' that &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; result from the consideration" of the social cost of greenhouse gases," wrote Judges Leslie Southwick, a George W. Bush appointee, and James Graves and Gregg Costa, both Barack Obama appointees, in their unanimous ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"This injury, however, hardly meets the standards for [constitutional] standing because it is, at this point, merely hypothetical," they continued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The Plaintiff States' claims are based on a generalized grievance of the use of Interim Estimates in cost-benefit analyses of regulations and agency action," according to the judges' opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"But their claimed injury does not stem from the Interim Estimates themselves, it stems from any forthcoming, speculative, and unknown regulation that may place increased burdens on them and may result."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next:&lt;/strong&gt; The Biden administration is appealing the full Louisiana injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the ruling in full, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21424359-scc-ruling" target="_blank"&gt;via DocumentCloud:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe

    <title>How stronger hands lengthen your life</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/hand-grip-strength-falling-deaths-8dfd77a1-0561-41be-8359-12532af948ce.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The single most effective set of muscles you can work to extend your life is in your hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;This shocked us, too. But many health and fitness experts argue that since falling is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; leading cause of injury-related death once we cross 65 years old, we should start strengthening our hands now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stunning stat: &lt;/strong&gt;The threat is getting worse. Death by falling increased 30% from 2009 to 2018, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/fall-deaths.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stronger hands grip tighter to prevent falls — and brace stronger when you tumble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grip strength is especially important for those older adults who use canes, walkers or handrails or need assistance getting out of chairs, says David Bellar, a kinesiologist at UNC Charlotte.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's not just bracing yourself. &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stronger-hands-linked-to-a-healthier-heart#:~:text=Earlier%20studies%20have%20linked%20grip,cardiovascular%20disease%20than%20blood%20pressure." target="_blank"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; stronger hands to healthier hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2815%2900267-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that higher grip strength was correlated to lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar and higher good cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do: &lt;/strong&gt;The most effective way to improve your grip strength is a simple dead hang, which works like it sounds — hanging still from a bar with your feet off the ground. Start by holding as long as you can, then work your way up from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or try the farmer's carry:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a walk around your house or gym with two heavy objects in your hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also work on your grip&lt;/strong&gt; while sitting down with some easy exercises.

    <title>CEOs turn to foreign policy experts to navigate Ukraine conflict</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/ceos-seek-foreign-policy-experts-41891f00-023f-4970-830a-05e679008b9e.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is prompting American CEOs anew to build their own mini-State Departments as they navigate the uncertainties of a war and world increasingly unbound by norms and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Executives traditionally rise to power by creating successful products and business lines, managing expectations and turning profits — not mastering foreign policy. With little margin for error, many are turning to D.C. experts with heightened urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we're hearing:&lt;/strong&gt; “Every CEO of a global business today has to make sure they have a real plan for geopolitical disruption,” said Robert Gibbs, former President Obama’s first White House press secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gibbs subsequently provided strategic communication for McDonald's, which this week closed its approximately 850 locations in Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He’s now senior counsel at Bully Pulpit Interactive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such corporate moves came as Russia threatened to arrest those &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/03/russia-protesters-arrests.html" target="_blank"&gt;branding its invasion a "war"&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/03/13/russia-putin-threatens-to-seize-assets-of-departing-western-companies/7026192001/" target="_blank"&gt;seize corporate assets&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for multinational firms departing from the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 400 companies have announced their intent to withdraw from Russia since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/400-companies-have-withdrawn-russia-some-remain" target="_blank"&gt;according to a list compiled&lt;/a&gt; by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washington, D.C.-based Beacon Global Strategies is monitoring 234 companies at latest count to analyze how they're responding to the crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis ranges from sanction compliance to hardening cyber defenses, said managing director and co-founder Jeremy Bash — a former CIA and Pentagon official.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Corporate concern about world affairs isn't completely new — especially in the financial services sector, which relies on global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Former national security adviser Tom Donilon has spent much of his time since leaving the Obama administration as chairman of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock" target="_blank"&gt;BlackRock Investment Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the Wall Street firm's global think tank. He advises customers — as well as executives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Finer, now serving as principal deputy national security adviser, came back into the federal government after serving as head of political risk and public policy at Warburg Pincus LLC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He'd previously worked as State Department chief of staff and director of policy planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as the protests after George Floyd's murder forced companies to review their posture on social issues, the invasion of Ukraine is putting a new batch of CEOs on notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each new round of international sanctions or Russian strikes on civilians or near a NATO border is forcing companies to analyze their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beyond sanctions and cyber, issues ranging from employee safety to growth strategy and statements of support or condemnation must be considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The uncertainty also highlights corporations' vulnerabilities around China's plans for Taiwan, Iran's nuclear program, North Korea's ambitions and potential conflicts that aren't yet as obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies also must consult with security experts about the safety of their worldwide locations — each of which carries their brand name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Most companies are turning to outside consultancies, stocked with former congressional, administration and defense officials to help them weigh risks and consider safer options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“CEOs and boards now need detailed advice and planning on national security issues — or they risk falling behind the fast-moving events, putting at risk their employees, their supply chains and their reputations,” Bash said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other companies like WestExec Advisors, the Cohen Group and the Eurasia Group, as well as white-shoe law firms, allow former officials to trade on their expertise and provide high-level briefings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current secretary of State, Antony Blinken, co-founded WestExec Advisors, where the current director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and current White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, formerly worked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security and a former National Security Council and congressional staffer, said he's fielding growing requests to brief companies in real time so they can react "virtually overnight."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"War and international politics," he said, "now directly impact the bottom line."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Defense contractors and companies that already do business with foreign governments have a head start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“From economic realities to national security threats to sustainability, we must have our finger on the world’s pulse,” Kathy Warden, chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman, tells Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We work with experts inside and outside of our company, using data and analytics to ensure a comprehensive view of the full environment."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies would rather react to clear government regulations than try to divine the shifting motives of politicians — especially the actions of authoritarian leaders like those in Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Ukrainians fear Russia diplomacy progress is a head fake</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The outlines of a potential deal to end the war in Ukraine are coming into focus, but sources on the Ukrainian side tell Axios they fear Moscow's newfound enthusiasm for diplomacy is a ruse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Kyiv has gained unexpected leverage by withstanding the Russian advance for three weeks, though the humanitarian crisis is deepening daily as Russia shells major cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;President Volodymyr Zelensky has hinted at an off-ramp by acknowledging that Ukraine will not be invited into NATO, but Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials doubt Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to take it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;After Zelensky said Ukraine wouldn’t be invited into NATO, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Ukraine's post-war "neutrality" could be based on the Austrian or Swedish models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are non-NATO members in the EU and firmly anchored in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b341e46-d375-4817-be67-802b7fa77ef1" target="_blank"&gt;FT then reported&lt;/a&gt; Russia and Ukraine had discussed a "15-point" draft peace plan during Monday's negotiations, and that significant progress had been made toward a deal. It would include Ukraine ruling out joining alliances or hosting foreign troops but receiving security guarantees from countries like the U.S., U.K. and Turkey, per the FT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No agreement has been reached on Russia's other core demands, including that Ukraine recognizes Russia's sovereignty in Crimea and the independence of the eastern "republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But at least in public, Russian officials have dropped their calls for regime change and "demilitarization," and Peskov's implication that Ukraine could join the EU was particularly striking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; An adviser to Zelensky told Axios he believes the Russians aren't yet serious about reaching a deal, though one could be reached in the next few weeks if the West and Ukrainian forces continue to pile pressure on Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maryan Zablotskyy, a member of parliament from Zelensky's party, told Axios the Russian side had started commenting publicly on details of the negotiations despite an agreement not to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He said that "damages the process and led us to some further doubts about how realistic it is."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zablotskyy added: "The question is whether [Putin] is really serious. The negotiators who are taking part in the negotiations seem like they are more serious than they were before. However, whether this is a ploy is still to be seen."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. view is similar. &lt;/strong&gt;While the White House had avoided high-level dialogue with Russia on the grounds that Moscow wasn't genuinely interested in diplomacy, national security adviser Jake Sullivan did speak to his Russian counterpart on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-emily-horne-on-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-call-with-nikolay-patrushev-secretary-of-the-russian-security-council-3/" target="_blank"&gt;the official White House statemen&lt;/a&gt;t on the call noted that "if Russia is serious about diplomacy, then Moscow should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S. officials continue to doubt Putin wants peace, as President Biden made clear Wednesday when he announced an additional $800 million in military aid. He also warned "a long and difficult battle" was likely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two European diplomats briefed on talks between Putin and his German and French counterparts also said they continue to expect further escalation from Russia for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Russian side, &lt;/strong&gt;Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that the text of a potential deal is “close to being agreed” to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But Putin himself reiterated his baseless claims that Zelensky's "pro-Nazi" government was committing genocide and seeking nuclear weapons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putin also said his "special military operation" was proceeding "successfully" and would be "solved" as planned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; Military analysts have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1499967954775121986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that Putin might soon seek a ceasefire to resupply his troops — without any intention of ending the war altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Biden says Putin is a "war criminal"</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/biden-putin-war-criminal-ukraine-e45248b5-ad96-4a80-a8e0-067629e45282.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;President Biden told reporters Wednesday that Vladimir Putin is a "war criminal," stating plainly what he had alluded to earlier in the day while condemning Russia's bombing of "apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals" and other civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;It's the first time Biden has used the term to describe the Russian president. Other senior officials had previously declined to go that far, instead expressing concern about alleged Russian atrocities and support for an international war crimes investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;Asked for clarification on Biden's comments, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing that the president's remarks "speak for themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what we’ve seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country," Psaki said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There is a legal process that continues to be underway at the State Department. That’s a process that they would have any updates on," she added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Biden's comments "unacceptable" and "unforgivable" rhetoric, according to &lt;a href="https://t.me/tass_agency/119715" target="_blank"&gt;Russian state media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback: &lt;/strong&gt;Less than a month into his presidency, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-vladimir-putin-killer-bf1c15a5-d698-4042-8c0c-5cfb124cd745.html" target="_blank"&gt;drew backlash&lt;/a&gt; in Russia after calling Putin a "killer" in a TV interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The International Criminal Court &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/war-crimes-hague-russia-ukraine-acad11de-5c3b-4631-8388-9933c145306f.html" target="_blank"&gt;launched an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into allegations of war crimes just days into Russia's invasion, after Ukraine accused Russian forces of indiscriminately shelling civilian areas and exploiting the definition of "genocide" as a pretense to invade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ukrainian officials on Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-mariupol-bombed-0ff78128-867d-4d74-9b16-2cfba7f9c249.html" target="_blank"&gt;accused Russia of bombing&lt;/a&gt; a theater in Mariupol that was serving as a refuge for hundreds of Ukrainians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russian forces have also repeatedly been accused of shelling "humanitarian corridors" set up to evacuate civilians from cities that have come under intense bombardment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The International Court of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/un-court-russia-ukraine-7dfb9996-f0af-4883-aa97-9a68a5eafe12.html" target="_blank"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; Russia to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine on Wednesday, though the top UN court has no mechanism to enforce its rulings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Fed raises rates, signals more on the way</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/fed-rate-increase-698953fc-84a0-401c-ab40-9d95adcea51d.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates a quarter-percentage point Wednesday and signaled many more rate increases are on the way as the central bank tries to quash sky-high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, the first rate rise since 2018. The median policymaker expects the rate to be 1.9% at the end of the year, implying a total of 7 rate hikes this year, and 2.8% at the end of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fed leaders also raised their projections for inflation and downgraded their forecasts for growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;The median Fed official expected inflation for personal consumption expenditures to be 4.3% in 2022, up from 2.6% projected in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excluding volatile food and energy, their median inflation forecast was 4.1%, up from 2.7% in December.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The officials also revised their forecast for GDP growth, and now expect the U.S. economy to grow only 2.8% this year, down from the 4% forecast in December.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;The Fed's rate-rising campaign is meant to rein in sky-high inflation by tightening financial conditions and slowing growth. But the central bank faces risks on both sides. The rate increases could be too little too late or they could endanger the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The war in Ukraine and associated commodity price increases, combined with shutdowns tied to new COVID outbreaks in China, could make for a bumpy year as the U.S. faces supply shocks, high inflation and tighter money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Already, mortgages rates and other longer-term rates have been rising so far this year on anticipation of a series of Fed rate hikes, acting as a restraint on the economy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"The committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so," Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He repeatedly expressed confidence that the expansion will remain robust even with rate hikes. "All signs are that this is a strong economy," Powell said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In their formal statement, the Fed policymakers said implications of the invasion of Ukraine for the U.S. economy "are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fed&lt;/strong&gt; also made plans to tighten the money supply by shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet and is likely to act on those plans "at a coming meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One official dissented&lt;/strong&gt;. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard preferred to raise interest rates half a percent at this policy meeting, favoring a more aggressive start to the rate rising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>U.S. weighs deal to remove Iran's IRGC from terror blacklist</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/us-weighs-deal-remove-irans-irgc-from-blacklist-c4aa21ed-5b57-4be7-bce6-3670a5dac453.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration is considering removing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from a terror blacklist in return for a public commitment from Iran to de-escalation in the region, three Israeli officials and two U.S. sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; An agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal is nearly complete, but Iran's demand that President Biden reverse Donald Trump's decision to designate the IRGC as a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/" target="_blank"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organization&lt;/a&gt; is a key remaining sticking point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The IRGC is not only Iran's most feared military branch, it's also a powerful political and economic player. The terror designation means that even if Biden lifts nuclear sanctions to return to compliance with the deal, criminal penalties could still be imposed on anyone doing business with individuals or businesses connected to the IRGC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But removing the designation is a political hot potato for Biden. It would create an uproar from Republicans and likely several Democrats in the Senate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; The IRGC designation is not directly related to the nuclear deal, and any decision would take the form of a separate bilateral understanding between the U.S. and Iran, according to the U.S. and Israeli sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One idea being discussed by the Biden administration would be a public announcement that the U.S. reserves the right to redesignate the IRGC if it determines that Iran did not follow through on its pledge to de-escalate in the region.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Israeli officials say the Biden administration briefed the Israeli government that such possibilities are being considered but stressed that no decisions have been made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Israeli government is concerned about the idea, and in particular, the fact that the U.S. didn't demand specific commitments from Iran not to target the U.S. and its allies in the region, two senior Israeli officials tell me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behind the scenes:&lt;/strong&gt; When former Vice President Mike Pence visited Israel last week, he claimed in meetings with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid that Biden planned to delist the IRGC in return for a more narrow commitment not to target Americans, two Israeli officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Israelis checked this in Washington, they were told the Biden administration had discussed this possibility but ruled it out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asked about Pence's description, a senior State Department official told Axios: “It should not be a surprise to anyone that descriptions of our talks from critics not involved in the process are inaccurate." Pence’s team declined to comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play:&lt;/strong&gt; The State Department official said no decision has been made on the IRGC designation and “any speculation to the contrary is simply uninformed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, the official stressed that regardless, the IRGC will remain on a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/15/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-persons-who-commit-or-support-terrorism/" target="_blank"&gt;separate terror list&lt;/a&gt; and subject to numerous sanctions, and the U.S. will still have a "panoply of tools to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another senior U.S. official claimed that it would be "pure speculation" to talk about details of a deal that isn't complete yet, but added, "It’s clear that President Trump and Vice President Pence’s withdrawal and maximum pressure campaign have been a clear failure" because Iran has only increased its nuclear activity and regional aggression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth noting:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump's 2019 designation of the IRGC as an FTO was the first time a state entity was added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Zelensky's impassioned speech rekindles congressional no-fly talk</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/zelensky-speech-congress-no-fly-36e404b0-d588-48e8-a58d-8af48c1d44ff.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;President Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned pleas Wednesday rekindled congressional talk of supporting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; While most members of Congress still maintain having the U.S. and NATO enforce such a zone would drag Americans into a superpower conflict with Russia, the openness of a few members to consider various options for air involvement represented a shift in tone from recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"I wouldn't say [a no-fly zone] is off the table," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told Axios while leaving the auditorium where members watched Zelensky's virtual address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, made the case for a limited humanitarian no-fly zone over a part of the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He also advocated for using non-kinetic ways to enforce a no-fly zone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We can ground airplanes without ever firing a shot. Now I'm sure one of the factors is that they don't want to front that technology ... but the technology does exist, and we can do it."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fitzpatrick specified in a later interview "we have to jam MAV systems and jam radar, you can ground aircraft without kinetic strikes," adding, "There's more to the story than just 'no-fly zone means WWIII.'"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told Axios &lt;/strong&gt;he's intrigued by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-airlift-could-save-ukraine-russia-putin-humanitarian-aid-kyiv-no-fly-zone-donations-11647288290?mod=opinion_lead_pos8" target="_blank"&gt;a Wall Street Journal op-ed&lt;/a&gt; proposing an international humanitarian airlift as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would involve countries not viewed as hostile to Russia — Brazil, Egypt, India and the United Arab Emirates — flying planes full of humanitarian goods into Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He started pitching the idea to his colleagues as they streamed out of the auditorium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I just think it's not all-or-nothing," Wicker said. "There are a myriad of nuanced ways to protect Ukraine from indiscriminate bombing of civilians."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During his remarks, Zelensky invoked&lt;/strong&gt; the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks in asking Americans to empathize with the daily onslaught Ukrainians face amid Russia's invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He also played a graphic video showing the destruction of his country, including the targeting of children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He closed his remarks by addressing the members in English.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some stopped short of calling for&lt;/strong&gt; international involvement in Ukraine's airspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) highlighted a slew of other actions the U.S. could take — supplying planes and more weaponry, closing all ports to Russian imports and sanctioning all leaders of Russia in addition to oligarchs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran who's feverishly pushed Congress and the Biden administration to send fighter jets and military aid, spelled out why a no-fly zone could not be implemented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We can't because we can't directly engage with Russia. That's a whole other level that does set up a much more widespread conflict."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; President Biden on Tuesday signed into law a bill that includes $13.6 billion for assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was expected to announce an additional $800 million in military aid in remarks a few hours after Zelensky's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who's previously resisted increasing U.S. defense spending, is prepared for the Biden administration to allocate even more money to Ukrainian military aid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We will continue to give them more help," she said. "We want to make sure that they have Javelins and Stingers and the other weapons to fight back."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Updates with comment from Rep.

        <![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned pleas Wednesday rekindled congressional talk of supporting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While most members of Congress still maintain having the U.S. and NATO enforce such a zone would drag Americans into a superpower conflict with Russia, the openness of a few members to consider various options for air involvement represented a shift in tone from recent days.</p><hr><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>"I wouldn't say [a no-fly zone] is off the table," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told Axios while leaving the auditorium where members watched Zelensky's virtual address.</p><ul><li>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees, made the case for a limited humanitarian no-fly zone over a part of the country.</li><li>He also advocated for using non-kinetic ways to enforce a no-fly zone.</li><li>"We can ground airplanes without ever firing a shot. Now I'm sure one of the factors is that they don't want to front that technology ... but the technology does exist, and we can do it."</li><li>Fitzpatrick specified in a later interview "we have to jam MAV systems and jam radar, you can ground aircraft without kinetic strikes," adding, "There's more to the story than just 'no-fly zone means WWIII.'"</li></ul><p><strong>Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told Axios </strong>he's intrigued by<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-airlift-could-save-ukraine-russia-putin-humanitarian-aid-kyiv-no-fly-zone-donations-11647288290?mod=opinion_lead_pos8" target="_blank">a Wall Street Journal op-ed</a> proposing an international humanitarian airlift as an alternative.</p><ul><li>It would involve countries not viewed as hostile to Russia — Brazil, Egypt, India and the United Arab Emirates — flying planes full of humanitarian goods into Ukraine.</li><li>He started pitching the idea to his colleagues as they streamed out of the auditorium.</li><li>"I just think it's not all-or-nothing," Wicker said. "There are a myriad of nuanced ways to protect Ukraine from indiscriminate bombing of civilians."</li></ul><p><strong>During his remarks, Zelensky invoked</strong> the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks in asking Americans to empathize with the daily onslaught Ukrainians face amid Russia's invasion.</p><ul><li>He also played a graphic video showing the destruction of his country, including the targeting of children.</li><li>He closed his remarks by addressing the members in English.</li></ul><p><strong>Some stopped short of calling for</strong> international involvement in Ukraine's airspace.</p><ul><li>Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) highlighted a slew of other actions the U.S. could take — supplying planes and more weaponry, closing all ports to Russian imports and sanctioning all leaders of Russia in addition to oligarchs.</li><li> Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran who's feverishly pushed Congress and the Biden administration to send fighter jets and military aid, spelled out why a no-fly zone could not be implemented.</li><li>"We can't because we can't directly engage with Russia. That's a whole other level that does set up a much more widespread conflict."</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> President Biden on Tuesday signed into law a bill that includes $13.6 billion for assistance to Ukraine.</p><ul><li>He was expected to announce an additional $800 million in military aid in remarks a few hours after Zelensky's.</li><li>Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who's previously resisted increasing U.S. defense spending, is prepared for the Biden administration to allocate even more money to Ukrainian military aid.</li><li>"We will continue to give them more help," she said. "We want to make sure that they have Javelins and Stingers and the other weapons to fight back."</li></ul><p><em>Editor's note: Updates with comment from Rep. Fitzpatrick.</em></p>]]>

    <title>Trump suggests Mike Pence would not be his running mate in 2024</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump signaled to the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-pence-partnership-over-as-ex-president-eyes-2024-comeback-bid" target="_blank"&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/a&gt; that he will not choose Mike Pence as his running mate if he runs for president in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What he's saying: &lt;/strong&gt;“I don’t think the people would accept it,” Trump said. "Mike and I had a great relationship except for the very important factor that took place at the end. We had a very good relationship. I haven’t spoken to him in a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mike thought he was going to be a human conveyor belt, that no matter how fraudulent the votes, you have to send them up to" then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump said.

However, he added that "I still like Mike" and called the former vice president "a really fine person."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Trump has said that Pence could have overturned the 2020 presidential election results as he presided over the counting of the electoral college votes, but Pence &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pence-trump-2020-election-21dd37c6-86eb-462a-b855-004c08801bf3.html" target="_blank"&gt;has maintained&lt;/a&gt; that the former president is "wrong" and that he "had no right" to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Jake Sullivan holds highest-level U.S. talks with Russia since invasion</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;National security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to the Russian Security Council on Wednesday and reiterated U.S. disapproval of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; It's the first public disclosure of a high-level call between U.S. and Russian officials since Moscow's attack on Ukraine started in late February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sullivan was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-sanctions-biden-blinken-629a96f2-5b92-4d1b-9b76-3f55497ecaad.html" target="_blank"&gt;among many Biden administration officials&lt;/a&gt;, including President Biden himself, who were sanctioned by the Russian government on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;The White House said Sullivan told Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, that the U.S. intends "to continue imposing costs on Russia, to support the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mr. Sullivan told Gen. Patrushev that if Russia is serious about diplomacy, then Moscow should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns. Mr. Sullivan also warned Gen. Patrushev about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine," the White House said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday pleaded for &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-congress-address-ba4fb223-7df5-47ed-aa3b-097c21cb1eae.html" target="_blank"&gt;additional assistance&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S., including the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

    <title>Methane emissions cuts as an Arctic ice shield</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Making significant,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;near-term methane emissions cuts in tandem with slashing carbon emissions would dramatically improve the odds that Arctic sea ice could survive during the summertime through 2100, a new study finds&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Sea ice loss is already having ramifications throughout the Arctic and beyond, affecting extreme weather events in the U.S. and Europe, altering the way of life for indigenous populations of the Far North and posing threats to iconic species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A seasonally ice-free Arctic, which at present emissions rates is expected to emerge as soon as the 2030s, would also present geopolitical risks as a contested region between the U.S. and Russia, among other countries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The findings are surprising given the different timescales on which these greenhouse gases operate, and the current downward trajectory of sea ice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The study, from a trio of researchers at the Environmental Defense Fund, adds to a growing body of work showing the potential benefits of slashing methane emissions. The &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4f10" target="_blank"&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt; was published Tuesday in &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers used computer modeling to determine the likelihood that certain policies to cut methane and carbon dioxide simultaneously might prevent the complete loss of Arctic sea ice in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If steep methane emissions cuts were to start now and be combined with aggressive reductions in CO2, then Arctic sea ice would have a fighting chance to survive the century and beyond. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Methane is a potent greenhouse gas but only remains in the air for a decade, compared to centuries to millennia for carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study finds that if all technically feasible methane emissions reduction measures were to be put in place by 2030, and carbon dioxide emissions reductions were to drop to net zero by 2050, there would be less than a 30% chance of routinely seeing sea ice-free Arctic summers through at least 2100. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study also looked at methane cuts and CO2 emissions reductions alone and found that neither would be sufficient. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;The seasonal minimum in Arctic sea ice extent has been &lt;a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2021/09/" target="_blank"&gt;decreasing at a rate of about 13% per decade&lt;/a&gt;. This is largely due to the effects of Arctic amplification, which refers to quirks in the polar climate that are causing this region to warm about three times faster than the rest of the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Methane is already on the global policy agenda. At the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/methane-limits-cop26-legacy-57b0cad6-0beb-4dad-aee6-da8119d01fb0.html" target="_blank"&gt;COP26 climate summit&lt;/a&gt; late last year, leaders from more than 100 countries agreed to make methane emissions cuts on the order of 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; It is unclear if countries will hit the 30% cuts they've committed to, and if they would undertake even more aggressive emissions reductions. Also, the study's modeling may miss some sea ice variability and trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they’re saying: &lt;/strong&gt;“Reducing current methane emissions represents a huge opportunity to help pump the brakes on global warming,” said lead author Tianyi Sun in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper is just focusing on the response of a single aspect of the climate system (sea ice) to a mitigation strategy that (if implemented) would be reflected in all parts of the climate system," Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., told Axios in an email.

    <title>Zelensky urges Congress to "remember 9/11" as he pleads for more aid for Ukraine</title>

    <description>&lt;iframe src="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/UZqPKLIA-AeXnLRNE.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto" allowfullscreen &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky summoned some of the darkest days in U.S. history in a virtual address to Congress, pleading for America to do more to stop Russia's assault on his country and calling on President Biden to “be the leader of the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What he's saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"Remember Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of Dec. 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” Zelensky told a packed auditorium in the basement of the Capitol. “Remember Sept. 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked from the air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Our country is experiencing the same every day, right now, at this moment,” he said. “Every night for three weeks now ... Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addressing President Biden directly, Zelensky said, "I wish for you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace." The auditorium erupted in a standing ovation as he concluded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Zelensky's deeply personal addresses to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-churchill-uk-parliament-ukraine-7af05f9e-58e8-457c-a636-74706760f7ec.html" target="_blank"&gt;Western lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-eu-leaders-last-time-you-see-me-alive-3447dbc0-620d-4ccc-afad-082e81d7a29f.html" target="_blank"&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt; over the past three weeks have helped Ukraine secure major new sanctions and commitments for its defense against Russia. Many would have been considered inconceivable just days prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom in: &lt;/strong&gt;Zelensky thanked Biden and Congress for all the support the U.S. has provided to Ukraine, but called on them to "do more" in the "darkest time" that Europe has seen in 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He urged the U.S. to impose new sanctions "every week until the Russian military machine stops," blacklist all Russian politicians and demand all American companies leave Russia's market "because it is flooded with our blood."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zelensky repeated his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but — acknowledging that this is a red line for the U.S. — asked for surface-to-air missile systems as an alternative so that the Ukrainian army can target Russian bombers on its own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward the end of his remarks, &lt;/strong&gt;Zelensky asked lawmakers to watch a graphic video compilation showing the destruction that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine and its people, including children. The video concluded with a request to "close the skies."

Today, my age stopped when the heart of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;In response to Zelensky's address, President Biden will announce in remarks at 11:45am ET that the U.S. is providing an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, according to a White House official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new funding is part of a $13.6 billion aid package to Ukraine that Congress passed last week and will include anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons that Ukraine had specifically requested. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition to that $800 million, Biden has also directed an &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-approves-200m-defense-assistance-ukraine-8990fb4d-82e9-4ee1-ba75-911683a9da53.html" target="_blank"&gt;additional $200 million in military aid&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to Ukraine from his presidential drawdown authority, bringing the total security assistance authorized over the past week to more than $1 billion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Zelensky first addressed more than 300 members of Congress and their staff via Zoom on March 5, where he pleaded with the U.S. to impose an oil embargo on Russia and transfer Soviet-era warplanes to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Biden administration agreed to ban Russian energy after overwhelming bipartisan pressure from Congress, but he has &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/poland-fighter-jets-ukraine-8c71b8b9-b22b-4f0f-aabd-789081ddb994.html" target="_blank"&gt;ruled out sending fighter jets&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns about logistics and the possibility of provoking Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under continued pressure from lawmakers and Ukrainian officials, the administration is exploring the possibility of providing advanced air-defense systems capable of targeting the Russian aircraft that have been wreaking havoc on Ukrainian cities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>DHS offering temporary protection and work permits to Afghans in U.S.</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/tps-afghanistan-dhs-immigration-refugee-f8a0199b-a8e3-4362-8d06-4ee44f778c10.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Afghans in the U.S. as of Tuesday can avoid deportation and obtain work permits for the next 18 months through Temporary Protected Status (TPS), the Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The new designation will ensure Afghans in the U.S. without proper documentation, whose temporary visas may soon expire or who were recently brought to the U.S. on parole can continue living and working in the U.S. without fear of return to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan for at least the next year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The government pointed to ongoing armed conflict in Afghanistan as reason for the designation. The conflict poses a serious safety threat "as the Taliban seeks to impose control in all areas of the country and Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) conducts attacks against civilians," DHS said&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DHS also cited the devastated economy in Afghanistan, drought, food and water insecurity, as well as other humanitarian concerns on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "TPS will also provide additional protections and assurances to trusted partners and vulnerable Afghans who supported the U.S. military" over the last 20 years, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roughly 80,000 Afghans have been evacuated and brought to the U.S. since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan last August. Most were brought in through a mechanism called parole, which provides them deportation protection and work permits for two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After that, seeking asylum is one of the only ways for many Afghans to legally stay in the U.S. long term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, Afghans brought here since August can apply for TPS, which will ensure protections for at least 18 months — and possibly longer if the status is extended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; TPS is used when immigrant home countries cannot safely accept those who have been deported. There are &lt;a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status" target="_blank"&gt;currently 12 countries&lt;/a&gt; with TPS designations, including Haiti, Somalia and Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As of last May, there were around 320,000 people living in the U.S. under the policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mayorkas has also recently announced new TPS statuses or extensions for &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-dhs-tps-ukrainian-immigrants-refugees-b8685c3f-e5ce-48b0-b15f-2b400924b267.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, South Sudan and Sudan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The White House is unveiling an initiative aimed at bolstering campus security and mental health services at historically Black colleges and universities in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hbcu-bomb-threats-black-history-month-163b6c3c-5d97-4d8c-9b61-1f72e5301f92.html" target="_blank"&gt;dozens of bomb threats&lt;/a&gt; at many of the institutions earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday will announce that HBCUs that recently experienced a bomb threat are eligible for grant funds for their "immediate needs," per the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The awards, which will come from the Project School Emergency Response to Violence program, may include "targeted mental health resources or enhanced security, to restore the learning environment on their campuses."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"[Department of Education] staff will work with each HBCU to help determine their specific immediate needs," per the White House.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The grant funds could range from $50,000 to $150,000 per school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The White House is also unveiling a resource guide for HBCUs from across the federal government "to help with long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, campus safety, and emergency management planning," per the White House.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;More than one-third of the country's HBCUs have received bomb threats over the last two months, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Biden administration said it has already delivered $5.8 billion to HBCUs, including more than $2.7 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "It is important to view these recent and repeated threats through both the lens of the present day as well as our country’s history," the White House said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The bomb threats that we witnessed in January, each week in February — Black History Month — and this month are reminiscent of the attempts during the Civil Rights era to intimidate and provoke fear in Black Americans."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hbcu-bomb-threats-black-history-month-163b6c3c-5d97-4d8c-9b61-1f72e5301f92.html" target="_blank"&gt;Over a dozen HBCUs get bomb threats on first day of Black History Month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>McCarthy enlists MIT in prep for speakership</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy is enlisting MIT to help his conference bone up on complex issues changing the world — drones, AI, hypersonic weapons — in hopes they'll be in charge next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;McCarthy's alliance with MIT is designed to add a future-focused dimension to the GOP agenda if the party wins the House majority in midterms, and he becomes Speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's happening: &lt;/strong&gt;McCarthy and several of his likely committee and subcommittee chairs spent Monday at the MIT School of Engineering, with in-person instruction from professors who are experts in: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Artificial intelligence (including applications for government and military) ... Quantum computing ... Life sciences (including vaccines) ... semiconductors ... and cybersecurity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCarthy said &lt;/strong&gt;in an interview that the two biggest long-term threats to the country are debt and China. He said the U.S. needs to be better prepared — including by becoming more self-sufficient on chip-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The structure of this body has to change," he said. "How do I raise the bar, and provide people with greater information so we can get better outcomes?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCarthy told Axios &lt;/strong&gt;he plans to develop an MIT-inspired course for committee leaders that eventually can be scaled to the full Congress: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"My mindset is continuing education."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>First major book on Biden administration reveals private confession about Kyrsten Sinema</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/jonathan-martin-alex-burns-book-biden-sinema-94352832-b1e8-465f-ada0-521729691c73.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;President Biden confessed in private&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that he didn't understand Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), who helped stymie his biggest legislative dreams, New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns write in the first major book about the Biden-Harris administration, coming May 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sneak peek: &lt;/strong&gt;"One person&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;close to the president likened Biden's perplexity at Sinema to his difficulty grasping his grandchildren's use of ... TikTok. He wanted to relate, but he just didn’t quite get it," the authors write in "&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Will-Not-Pass-Americas/dp/1982172487" target="_blank"&gt;This Will Not Pass&lt;/a&gt;," about the 2020 election and President Biden's first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the spring of 2021,&lt;/strong&gt; "she became the first-ever lawmaker to argue with White House aides when they asked her to wear a face mask in the company of the president, repeatedly asking why that was necessary when she had been vaccinated."  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She also discouraged&lt;/strong&gt; Biden from coming to Arizona after the president signed the COVID rescue plan in 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden aides complained &lt;/strong&gt;that Sinema sounded more like Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) than a Democrat, the book says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At a private fundraiser &lt;/strong&gt;in D.C. with a Republican-heavy group of lobbyists — which hasn't been reported before — she portrayed herself as anti-tax and anti-government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She mocked Biden&lt;/strong&gt; while speaking warmly about House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, and even defending far-right Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), who denied the election results and claimed Antifa had infiltrated the Capitol riot. "I love Andy Biggs," she said.  "I know some people think he’s crazy, but that's just because they don’t know him."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separately, &lt;/strong&gt;Sinema told colleagues five or six other Senate Dem moderates were "hiding behind my skirt" as she pushed back on the left. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;The title alludes to this period of political tumult not passing with the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A big reason &lt;/strong&gt;we wanted to capture all of 2021 rather than just ending with the campaign aftermath or Jan. 6 is because there's so much more to report about the ongoing strain in both parties," JMart told me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Trumpism on the right&lt;/strong&gt; is a central theme. But more broadly we wanted to capture how both party establishments are being tested like never before."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Jan. 6, &lt;/strong&gt;an enraged Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) telephoned White House counsel Pat Cipollone and told him that if President Trump didn't act more aggressively to denounce the mob "we’ll be asking you for the 25th Amendment" to remove Trump from office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an in-person interview&lt;/strong&gt; with the authors that afternoon, after they all evacuated from the Senate, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed optimism that the riot could become a turning point: "People will say, 'I don't want to be associated with that' ... There will be a rallying effect for a while, the country says: We're better than this." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graham suggested&lt;/strong&gt; Biden was the right man for this time: "I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burns and Martin &lt;/strong&gt;were represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has become tech's favorite Biden official</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, President Biden's most powerful appointee on tech, has largely been an ally to the sector, defending U.S. tech firms abroad and pushing for funding domestically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; With Big Tech critics in charge of the government's antitrust enforcement efforts, Raimondo has become the industry's key advocate within the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's happening: &lt;/strong&gt;Raimondo has taken heat from progressives after s&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-raimondo-vestager-big-tech-europe-6d9df23c-9e1f-41cf-a5af-51ecd1b5f990.html" target="_blank"&gt;he criticized &lt;/a&gt;two European regulatory proposals for disproportionately targeting American tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Progressive advocacy group Fight Corporate Monopolies on Tuesday announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrH2uqN5tZc" target="_blank"&gt;a new digital ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; against Raimondo aimed at voters in Nevada and New Hampshire. The ads demand she release her calendars and disclose meetings with Big Tech companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;Raimondo deserves praise for "pushing back on flawed and discriminatory regulatory approaches coming out of Europe," Chamber of Commerce senior vice president for international regulatory affairs and antitrust Sean Heather told Axios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/15/bidens-commerce-chief-is-under-fire-warren-progressives-defending-us-tech-giants/" target="_blank"&gt;told the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; he'd rather see U.S. officials regulating Big Tech than "bureaucrats in Brussels," and a bipartisan group of House lawmakers backed Raimondo's approach to the European measure in a letter to Biden in February.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raimondo supports the goals of the European proposal, the Digital Markets Act, and is working to coordinate U.S. and European digital regulatory approaches, a Commerce Department spokesperson told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context: &lt;/strong&gt;Historically, Commerce secretaries defend American companies against foreign regulations that may impact their business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raimondo founded a venture capital firm before becoming governor of Rhode Island.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;At home, Raimondo has been a key player on the Hill in advocating for funding that would boost the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;She was deeply involved in negotiations on the bipartisan infrastructure law, with her agency &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/fcc-broadband-infrastructure-bill-b5fa310d-2a32-4866-861b-1eba0915b394.html" target="_blank"&gt;winning control&lt;/a&gt; over nearly $50 billion in funding for high-speed internet access and deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She has also kept a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/raimondo-commerce-secretary-chips-funding-89349cb6-9b17-465a-bc1b-121857e29454.html" target="_blank"&gt;steady drumbeat&lt;/a&gt; of pressure on lawmakers on the need to pass legislation that would dedicate $52 billion to domestic semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"She's the Cabinet voice for the American business community and she's taken that role seriously and has embraced it. And as a result, we feel like we have a very strong advocate," Al Thompson, Intel vice president of U.S. government relations, told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of note: &lt;/strong&gt;FTC chair Lina Khan and Department of Justice antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter are both well-known for their views that Big Tech has too much power, and longtime anti-monopoly evangelist Tim Wu is at the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"[The Biden Administration] made tough appointments on antitrust and tech regulation, and other cabinet secretaries don't touch on these issues at all, and the Secretary of Commerce, as a booster of American business, cares about discriminatory treatment of U.S. companies," one senior tech industry official told Axios. "It can all work together."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;Raimondo listens to businesses and has been effective in negotiations toward a new privacy agreement with Europe and conversations around artificial intelligence, Craig Albright, vice president of legislative strategy for software industry group BSA, told Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"She is an action person," Albright said. "She is making the phone calls, she's making the case. She's very active in her advocacy. She's very inclusive in getting input from the outside. She's a star player."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;Small and medium-sized tech companies led by Yelp took issue with her comments on the Digital Markets Act and met with Commerce staff in January to air their concerns, per a source familiar with the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raimondo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250746/biden-gina-raimondo-commerce-secretary-section-230" target="_blank"&gt;also indicated&lt;/a&gt; she wants to take on platform accountability issues and reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a  provision that protects websites from liability from content posted by their users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She has also made clear she expects businesses to work with her on bias in AI and on the effect of technology on workers, Albright said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; "We're not getting a free pass," he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>2021 brought historic breakthroughs for Asians in America, but at an enormous cost</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the year since the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/atlanta-spa-shooting-asian-american-hate-crimes-232d362d-72bd-49eb-8658-28dca61dfc53.html" target="_blank"&gt;shooting death of six Asian women&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta-area spas, more people of Asian descent have been elevated across politics, sports and entertainment than ever before, while the larger community has &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hate-crimes-asian-hate-breaks-records-643c7d8c-56e4-4cc3-b865-c51a9eff5e18.html" target="_blank"&gt;continued to struggle with anti-Asian attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The Atlanta shootings, which killed eight people in total, put a new spotlight on a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/anti-asian-racism-violence-history-1ecd62dc-1219-4dff-aac5-70f1af0118f6.html" target="_blank"&gt;historically overlooked and vilified group&lt;/a&gt;. But the tragedy also resulted in visibility that enabled Asians in America to make new strides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"There was so much attention on the hate crimes [from this past year] … that it made Asian Americans [speak out to say] we are part of this racial landscape," Pawan Dhingra, incoming president of the Association for Asian American Studies, told Axios. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;The scale and impact of the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.axios.com/politics-policy/black-lives-matter-movement/" target="_blank"&gt;Black Lives Matter Movement&lt;/a&gt; following the killing of George Floyd enabled people to start talking about systemic racism in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the time the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.axios.com/axios-today-podcast-atlanta-spa-shooting-fd75981b-4311-4a0d-a085-925012a6b56a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Atlanta shootings took place&lt;/a&gt;, public dialogue could tie in the impact of race, sociologist Nancy Wang Yuen told Axios. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The media was asking Yuen to educate and not "to defend whether Asians were victims," she said. "It was just obvious to everyone."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashback: &lt;/strong&gt;Asian Americans had already been living every day looking over their shoulders since the onset of the pandemic, when President Trump began to repeatedly call the outbreak the "&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/civil-rights-lawsuit-trump-china-virus-covid-ba2ba751-d614-44e6-9f7c-4dce29b7f1aa.html" target="_blank"&gt;China virus&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even before the mass shooting in Atlanta, attacks like the one that led to the death of &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/violent-attacks-elderly-asian-americans-f51600d1-544e-4a9c-a451-dda227679eb6.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vicha Ratanapakdee&lt;/a&gt;, an 84-year-old Thai grandfather, had started to &lt;a href="https://theyappie.com/aapi-activists-rising-above-hate/" target="_blank"&gt;galvanize the community&lt;/a&gt; and activate media coverage of the growing number of anti-Asian attacks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around the same time, the swearing-in of Kamala Harris as the&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/harris-breaks-multiple-barriers-as-vp-elect-ea9a9aa9-253b-4566-ae20-bbd553487781.html" target="_blank"&gt; first Black and Asian vice president of the United States&lt;/a&gt; marked a symbolic kick-off to what would become an explosive year for Asian political representation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A snowball effect: &lt;/strong&gt;"People saw that Asian Americans are able to tell their own stories, that we can … demand recognition as members of this country. It helps see us as people worth electing, people who can represent non-Asians in their localities," Dhingra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boston&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/michelle-wu-boston-mayor-asian-american-43fa4954-9fb6-4706-b255-d8e4bb39442b.html" target="_blank"&gt; chose Michelle Wu as mayor&lt;/a&gt;; Aftab Pureval became the first Asian American mayor of Cincinnati, and Bruce Harrell became the first Asian American and second Black mayor of Seattle. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In New York City, five Asian Americans were elected to the city council, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/nyc-council-5-new-asian-americans-mirroring-city-accurately-rcna4412" target="_blank"&gt;most to date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media visibility&lt;/strong&gt; rose to a new level too following the box office success of Marvel’s Asian-led "&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/shang-chi-black-widow-biggest-film-north-america-2021-bccd5377-ea1f-4856-ab08-35bd82020553.html" target="_blank"&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/eternals-casting-asians-refreshing-history-fantasy-erasure-critics-say-rcna5886" target="_blank"&gt;Eternals&lt;/a&gt;," which were in the top ten 10 highest-grossing films &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2021/?ref_=bo_yl_table_2" target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chloe Zhao, a Chinese filmmaker,&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/chloe-zhao-first-woman-of-color-oscars-best-director-win-9d9dc5fa-900d-462c-9f7c-b812eb3a4c94.html" target="_blank"&gt; became the first woman of color&lt;/a&gt; to win the Oscar for Best Director.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the Tokyo Olympics, Sunisa Lee became the first Asian American woman to take gold in the gymnastics all-around event and helped&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/olympics-gymnastics-sunisa-suni-lee-hmong-results-291a63ce-4cbb-4630-888a-553440e7f8b0.html" target="_blank"&gt; shine a light specifically on Hmong Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;"Visibility will die down, arguably already has died down," Dhingra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;And because of &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/china-stories-were-watching-in-2022-30c9212c-8476-4a60-a6ec-27aa5fec92a1.html" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing tensions with Asia&lt;/a&gt;, "the kind of racial system that conflates Asian Americans with Asians" ingrains the idea that "Asians are forever foreigners," said Yuen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;83% of Asian adults say Asians faced more discrimination in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/04/08/asian-americans-mental-health-racism-violence-poll/" target="_blank"&gt;according to an April poll by Morning Consult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth noting: &lt;/strong&gt;The Atlanta &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/atlanta-spa-shooting-pleads-guilty-cc183f44-11b9-4c9f-8a9e-d3c17f4957d9.html" target="_blank"&gt;killer was sentenced to life without parole last summer&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/atlanta-shootings-victims-cherokee-county-fd653c24-c81c-43db-b807-02627b73e6e8.html" target="_blank"&gt;murdering four of the eight victims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He is now facing charges in Fulton Country, Georgia, for the other four killings where the district attorney is seeking the death penalty and sentencing enhancement under Georgia's new hate crimes law, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/28/1041137210/atlanta-spa-shooting-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-robert-aaron-long" target="_blank"&gt;per NPR.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;"There is no quick fix.

    <title>Russia is testing the West's favorite weapon</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/us-europe-russia-ukraine-sanctions-8bbb85a8-17c2-4ffc-9229-fa27d5a2465b.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented sanctions the West imposed on Russia have hobbled its  economy and are hurting the global system, too. But their primary purpose, arguably, is to stop the fighting. And that's not yet happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Sanctions are increasingly one of the go-to tools in &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/world/axios-explains-ukraine/" target="_blank"&gt;American foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;, all over the world — that doesn't mean they always work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Have sanctions given Putin a powerful incentive to cut a deal? Yes. But is that incentive strong enough for Putin to actually end the war? That's doubtful," said Edward Fishman, a former sanctions policy official during the Obama administration and now a Fellow at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The EU imposed a &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/15/russia-s-military-aggression-against-ukraine-fourth-eu-package-of-sectoral-and-individual-measures/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Russia%25u2019s+military+aggression+against+Ukraine%3A+fourth+EU+package+of+sectoral+and+individual+measures" target="_blank"&gt;fourth round of sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on Russia yesterday, prohibiting investments in the country's energy sector,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;adding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more trade restrictions and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;oligarch punishments. Later in the day, the U.S. sanctioned &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-announces-sanctions-on-key-members-of-russias-defense-enterprise/" target="_blank"&gt;11 Russian military leaders&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60754136" target="_blank"&gt;Russia sanctioned President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war," EU official Josep Borrell said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, sanctions are a negotiation tool, part of a carrot-stick strategy that gets your opponent to the bargaining table. The best known example of this working is in the negotiations by the U.S. leading up to the first Iran nuclear deal. But these measures serve other, less obvious purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To express moral outrage. &lt;/strong&gt;Some sanctions signal that certain behaviors are not tolerated and are outside established norms. Measured simply along these lines, the Russia sanctions worked. Loads of companies, for example, "self-sanctioned," or pulled out of the country voluntarily. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To inflict economic pain. &lt;/strong&gt;This is part of getting Russia to the negotiating table, of course.

        <![CDATA[<p>The unprecedented sanctions the West imposed on Russia have hobbled its  economy and are hurting the global system, too. But their primary purpose, arguably, is to stop the fighting. And that's not yet happening.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Sanctions are increasingly one of the go-to tools in<a href="https://www.axios.com/world/axios-explains-ukraine/" target="_blank">American foreign policy</a>, all over the world — that doesn't mean they always work.</p><hr><ul><li>"Have sanctions given Putin a powerful incentive to cut a deal? Yes. But is that incentive strong enough for Putin to actually end the war? That's doubtful," said Edward Fishman, a former sanctions policy official during the Obama administration and now a Fellow at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy.</li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The EU imposed a<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/15/russia-s-military-aggression-against-ukraine-fourth-eu-package-of-sectoral-and-individual-measures/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Russia%25u2019s+military+aggression+against+Ukraine%3A+fourth+EU+package+of+sectoral+and+individual+measures" target="_blank">fourth round of sanctions</a> on Russia yesterday, prohibiting investments in the country's energy sector,<strong> </strong>adding<strong> </strong>more trade restrictions and<strong> </strong>oligarch punishments. Later in the day, the U.S. sanctioned<a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-announces-sanctions-on-key-members-of-russias-defense-enterprise/" target="_blank">11 Russian military leaders</a>; and<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60754136" target="_blank">Russia sanctioned President Biden</a>, too.</p><ul><li>"The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war," EU official Josep Borrell said in a statement.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Ideally, sanctions are a negotiation tool, part of a carrot-stick strategy that gets your opponent to the bargaining table. The best known example of this working is in the negotiations by the U.S. leading up to the first Iran nuclear deal. But these measures serve other, less obvious purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>To express moral outrage. </strong>Some sanctions signal that certain behaviors are not tolerated and are outside established norms. Measured simply along these lines, the Russia sanctions worked. Loads of companies, for example, "self-sanctioned," or pulled out of the country voluntarily.</li><li><strong>To inflict economic pain. </strong>This is part of getting Russia to the negotiating table, of course.

    <title>Zelensky says peace talks "more realistic" as Russian forces bombard Kyiv</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday peace talks were beginning to "sound more realistic," as the war entered its third week with Russian forces intensifying attacks on Kyiv and Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"Efforts are still needed, patience is needed," Zelensky said during a &lt;a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/opir-stijkist-ta-horobrist-nashih-zahisnikiv-dayut-zmogu-zbe-73589" target="_blank"&gt;televised address&lt;/a&gt;. "Any war ends with an agreement," added Zelensky, who thanked the U.S. ahead &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/zelensky-push-us-red-lines-congress-2e08f197-54a5-45bb-aec6-e46523ec8f13.html" target="_blank"&gt;of his congressional address&lt;/a&gt; later Wednesday for a $13.6 billion aid package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ukrainian presidential aid Mykhailo Podolyak, a member of the peace talks delegation, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Podolyak_M/status/1503818663866023942" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that "fundamental contradictions" remained as peace talks with Russian officials were expected to continue Wednesday. "But there is certainly room for compromise," he added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it's too early to say how negotiations were progressing, but "in the current situation the very fact that [negotiations] are continuing is probably positive," &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/peace-talks-more-realistic-says-ukraine-president-biden-visit-nato-2022-03-16/" target="_blank"&gt;per Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that "there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement," Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-lavrov-says-neutrality-ukraine-being-seriously-discussed-2022-03-16/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth noting: &lt;/strong&gt;Zelensky indicated during a video-link to leaders of the British-led Joint Expeditionary Force Tuesday that he realized Ukraine couldn't soon become a NATO member, saying, "We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It's a truth and it must be recognized," he added. "I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and on our partners who assist us."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Russian airstrikes on Kyiv Wednesday morning destroyed several residential buildings and killed at least two people, Ukraine's state emergency services &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MNS.GOV.UA/posts/333611088806787" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.

But Putin's ground forces were "making little to no progress around the country." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;/strong&gt;the U.S. Ministry of Defense said in&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503982627522494465" target="_blank"&gt;intelligence update &lt;/a&gt;Wednesday that Russia's military has been "struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine's terrain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Russian forces have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvre. The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance," the Defense Ministry added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Russia's continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvre, further limiting their options" in the face of Ukrainian resistance, according to the statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: "&lt;/strong&gt;Russia is increasingly seeking to generate additional troops to bolster and replace its personnel losses in Ukraine," the U.K. Defense Ministry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503851779175370760" target="_blank"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Kremlin "is redeploying forces from as far afield as its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet and Armenia. It is also increasingly seeking to exploit irregular sources such as Private Military Companies, Syrian and other mercenaries," the update added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Russia will likely attempt to use these forces to hold captured territory and free up its combat power to renew stalled offensive operations."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/world/axios-explains-ukraine/" target="_self"&gt;Axios explains Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_self"&gt;The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Why there’s never been a better time to start a business</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s never been a better time to start your own company. That helps explain why America just witnessed the biggest business startup boom of our lifetimes, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the U.S. census&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;5.4 million people applied for small businesses licenses last year — a 53% jump from 2019, pre-pandemic. Global investment in startups shattered records in 2021, &lt;a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/" target="_blank"&gt;hitting $643 billion&lt;/a&gt; — 10 times what it was 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people don't have the luxury of starting their own businesses. For those who do, especially young people, several trends make it more appealing than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety net. &lt;/strong&gt;The job market for college-educated talent is hot, so there's a very viable Plan B if you fail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work-from-anywhere. &lt;/strong&gt;Talent is spreading everywhere — so your ability to find partners and workers is no longer confined to your physical location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs are sinking. &lt;/strong&gt;Many workers no longer expect an office or a building, so one big cost has vanished.

"So I called on my old skills," he says — repairing bikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bike shops were overwhelmed at the start of the pandemic — everyone wanted to stay outdoors and active.

    <title>Inside Schumer and Manchin's secret Italian dinner</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/schumer-manchin-secret-italian-dinner-008ab305-bee1-4c2e-9b20-f562df09f72e.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A private Italian dinner between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) did little to repair their differences over how Democrats can retain power in the Senate, Axios has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Schumer’s failure last month to convince Manchin to be more of a team player has implications for the leader’s ability to advance President Biden’s agenda, not to mention the fate of his nominees — as Fed hopeful Sarah Bloom Raskin &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/federal-reserve-sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-e1f9b300-98ff-4315-a5e8-44c144d0ef79.html" target="_blank"&gt;discovered this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two longtime friends, who use frank and colorful language with each other, successfully reset their strained relationship, Axios is told.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But their political dynamic remained unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manchin is unwilling to forsake voter concerns at home in West Virginia for the good of the national Democratic Party.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; Inside the Trattoria Alberto, an Italian institution in a once unfashionable part of Capitol Hill, Schumer tried to persuade Manchin to stop slowing down their party's agenda in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manchin responded by telling Schumer he needed to be more persuasive, and that the burden was on the majority leader to allow the process to play out — and bring the entire Democratic caucus along.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two senators dined alone and without staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mid-February dinner was on the books before Axios &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/schumers-frayed-relationship-manchin-97785dd4-e31d-4534-852e-d5536c9e3a7c.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported the failed&lt;/a&gt; Build Back Better negotiations had left their relationship frayed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; “Sen. Manchin and Sen. Schumer had a friendly and productive conversation over a delicious dinner of spaghetti and meatballs,” said Sam Runyon, Manchin's communications director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A spokesman for Schumer declined comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; While Schumer is his party’s Senate leader and controls the floor schedule, in a 50-50 Senate, an unbowed Manchin has exerted more power at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He first trimmed Biden’s Build Back Better proposal from $3.5 trillion to $1.5 trillion, before pronouncing himself a “No” on the package — effectively killing the ambitious social spending and climate legislation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last July, Manchin and Schumer signed a unique document, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/30/manchin-proposed-15t-topline-number-to-schumer-this-summer-514803" target="_blank"&gt;unveiled by Politico in late September&lt;/a&gt;, establishing Manchin’s top-line spending number at $1.5 trillion, the need to offset all new spending with fresh revenue and his concerns about inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manchin is now signaling an openness to a much smaller bill, but one that raises twice as much as it spends. Half of the new revenues would have to be dedicated to deficit reduction, which Manchin believes will help ease inflation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Schumer knows he has to keep talking to Manchin if there's any hope of passing legislation to address climate change, lower prescription drug costs and shore up the Affordable Care Act, Axios is told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manchin will keep listening but needs to hear from the president that his concerns about inflation — and protecting West Virginia's energy industry — will be addressed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>RNC sues Salesforce to block Jan. 6 committee data dump</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/rnc-sues-salesforce-to-block-jan-6-committee-data-dump-383859ea-b24a-403f-88ad-f204cbac169c.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Republican National Committee is suing its own email vendor, Salesforce, in a last-ditch effort to stop it from turning over extensive internal data to the Jan. 6 select committee, Axios has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The RNC is seeking an emergency injunction to block the software giant from complying with a subpoena from the panel investigating the Capitol riot by a 10am ET Wednesday deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Absent an injunction, the committee would gain access to extensive data on RNC and Trump campaign fundraising practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's seeking that information as part of an investigation into the use of false claims about 2020 election fraud to raise money for Trump-aligned political efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The subpoenaed records include extensive information on who at the RNC sent its fundraising emails, who received them and how effective they were at raising money in the wake of the 2020 election.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt;: The subpoena seeks RNC and Trump campaign fundraising data gleaned from its use of Salesforce email marketing software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The RNC is also amending a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/rnc-lawsuit-salesforce-jan6-committee-05488227-4ea9-49ee-8208-52ead613db56.html" target="_blank"&gt;lawsuit filed last week&lt;/a&gt; against the committee to include Salesforce as a defendant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Axios reviewed copies of both the amended complaint and the injunction motion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;The RNC says Salesforce made initial assurances it would not turn over that data while its lawsuit against the committee was pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But one day after Axios reported on the lawsuit, Salesforce told the RNC it was legally obligated to produce the requested records and would do so regardless of the litigation, the amended complaint says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;The RNC has "asked the court to expedite consideration of the case,” chief counsel Justin Riemer told Axios in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's added Salesforce to the lawsuit, he said, "in order to protect the constitutional rights of the Republican Party and its millions of supporters." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Even though the court has yet to weigh in, the Select Committee demands that Salesforce immediately turn over the private data of millions of Americans and the RNC’s political strategy, which lie at the heart of our lawsuit."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Salesforce spokesperson&lt;/strong&gt; declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee also declined to comment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget: &lt;/strong&gt;The RNC has been alleging that the Jan. 6 Committee is not properly structured and therefore lacks subpoena power at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts told Axios last week that courts have traditionally been reluctant to limit Congress' investigative powers, but that an RNC victory in the case — which also alleges First and Fourth Amendment violations — is not out of the question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>U.S. providing over $186M in additional humanitarian aid to Ukraine</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/us-humanitarian-aid-ukraine-a51416d8-7ee9-4588-a2dc-d9b55e8f2313.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is providing over $186 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians internally displaced or forced to flee abroad by Russia's &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;unprovoked invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. has provided nearly $293 million to Ukraine and the region since the start of the invasion in late February, including the new aid. It makes the U.S. the "largest single-country donor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine," Blinken said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ukraine-refugees-russian-invasion-un-9f8b6e8e-87ed-4a5b-b7e9-d9229b373dca.html" target="_blank"&gt;3 million refugees&lt;/a&gt; have fled Ukraine since the start of the invasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly 2 million people have been internally displaced inside Ukraine due to the crisis, a senior administration official told reporters on a call Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The additional funding will go towards further bolstering humanitarian organizations "responding to the crisis and complement the generosity of the neighboring countries that are welcoming and supporting refugees," Blinken said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"We call for an immediate end to Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine and for Russia to facilitate unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine and safe passage for those who seek to leave the cities where they are trapped," he added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The aid going to neighboring countries will provide Ukrainian refugees with food, safe drinking water, shelter and emergency health care, among other benefits, he noted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt; The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that the U.S. has provided nearly $293 in aid to Ukraine including the $186 million announced Tuesday.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Senate passes bill to make daylight saving time permanent</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/daylight-saving-time-bill-senate-e391d97a-1a88-40eb-a42f-f8eb30f32136.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed a measure that would make daylight saving time permanent across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; If the legislation clears the House and is signed into law by President Biden, it will mean Americans will no longer have to change their clocks twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The bill — the Sunshine Protection Act co-sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — was passed by unanimous consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would make daylight saving time permanent in 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Health groups have called for an end to the seasonal shifting of clocks, a ritual first adopted in the U.S. more than a century ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At a house hearing last week, health experts cited sleep deprivation and health problems as negative effects associated with changing clocks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans want to stop changing their clocks, according to a 2021 &lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/11/04/daylight-saving-time-americans-want-stay-permanent" target="_blank"&gt;Economist/YouGov poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; "No more dark afternoons in the winter. No more losing an hour of sleep every spring. We want more sunshine during our most productive waking hours," Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said on the Senate floor after the passage of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, but, but: &lt;/strong&gt;In the 1970s — the last time Congress made daylight saving time permanent — the decision was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2022/03/15/the-us-tried-permanent-daylight-saving-time-in-the-70s-people-hated-it/" target="_blank"&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; in less than a year after the early morning darkness proved dangerous for school children and public sentiment changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next: &lt;/strong&gt;Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) will lead a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling for immediate House passage of his bill, Axios has learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Sarah Bloom Raskin withdraws Federal Reserve nomination</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/federal-reserve-sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-e1f9b300-98ff-4315-a5e8-44c144d0ef79.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination to become vice chair of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the White House confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Raskin's nomination was effectively set to fail after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/manchin-sarah-bloom-raskin-fed-d1d72789-e450-4842-811f-7f48b1c626da.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced his opposition on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The setback reflects resistance to integrating &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/federal-reserve-raskin-climate-fossil-fuels-5297b0fa-6255-435d-9f5b-041e6251adbe.html" target="_blank"&gt;climate change risk analysis&lt;/a&gt; into the U.S.'s top financial regulatory institution, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/sarah-raskin-climate-change-views-sink-fed-nominee-c60c1d94-9a34-4141-935e-05c73f0609cd.html" target="_blank"&gt;Axios' Andrew Freedman writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What she's saying: &lt;/strong&gt;Raskin, who has served as a governor on the Fed board as well as deputy secretary of the Treasury, wrote in her letter that the opposition to her nomination this time around is a result of an unwillingness to "acknowledge the economic complications of climate change and the toll it has placed, and will continue to place, on Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"It was — and is — my considered view that the perils of climate change must be added to the list of serious risks that the Federal Reserve considers as it works to ensure the stability and resiliency of our economy and financial system."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"This is not a novel or radical position," she said, adding that central banks around the world have already taken action on the issue. "Any vice chair for supervision who ignored these realities — which are manifesting every day across this country — would be guilty of gross dereliction of duty."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"These risks cannot be dismissed for political reasons, certainly at this moment when the possibilities of mitigating them still exist," she noted. "If I step away from this confirmation process, there can be no excuse left for a continued boycott of the Constitution’s 'advice and consent' process and the Senate’s corresponding refusal to attend to our nation’s real economic needs."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-her-nomination-to-the-federal-reserve-board" target="_blank"&gt;New Yorker first broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Raskin was removing herself from the running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biden confirmed the withdrawal &lt;/strong&gt; in a statement Tuesday afternoon, noting Raskin's credentials and "unparalleled experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Despite her readiness—and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past—Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups," he said. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He thanked Raskin for her willingness to serve and urged the Senate Banking Committee to move swiftly to confirm the four other nominees for the Fed's Board of Governors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Manchin had said that Raskin's public statements "failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;She has advocated for banks and their regulators to &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/us-financial-regulators-climate-change-by-sarah-bloom-raskin-2021-09" target="_blank"&gt;shift funding away from fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt; and toward clean energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without Raskin in the role of vice chair, big banks &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/sarah-raskin-climate-change-views-sink-fed-nominee-c60c1d94-9a34-4141-935e-05c73f0609cd.html" target="_blank"&gt;won't have to worry as much&lt;/a&gt; about continuing to finance fossil fuel projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This post has been updated with comments from President Biden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

"Any vice chair for supervision who ignored these realities — which are manifesting every day across this country — would be guilty of gross dereliction of duty."</li><li>"These risks cannot be dismissed for political reasons, certainly at this moment when the possibilities of mitigating them still exist," she noted. "If I step away from this confirmation process, there can be no excuse left for a continued boycott of the Constitution’s 'advice and consent' process and the Senate’s corresponding refusal to attend to our nation’s real economic needs."</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-her-nomination-to-the-federal-reserve-board" target="_blank">New Yorker first broke the news</a> that Raskin was removing herself from the running.</p><p><strong>Biden confirmed the withdrawal </strong> in a statement Tuesday afternoon, noting Raskin's credentials and "unparalleled experience."</p><ul><li>"Despite her readiness—and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past—Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups," he said. </li><li>"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people."</li><li>He thanked Raskin for her willingness to serve and urged the Senate Banking Committee to move swiftly to confirm the four other nominees for the Fed's Board of Governors.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Manchin had said that Raskin's public statements "failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs."</p><ul><li>She has advocated for banks and their regulators to <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/us-financial-regulators-climate-change-by-sarah-bloom-raskin-2021-09" target="_blank">shift funding away from fossil fuels</a> and toward clean energy.</li><li>Without Raskin in the role of vice chair, big banks <a href="https://www.axios.com/sarah-raskin-climate-change-views-sink-fed-nominee-c60c1d94-9a34-4141-935e-05c73f0609cd.html" target="_blank">won't have to worry as much</a> about continuing to finance fossil fuel projects.</li></ul><p><em>Editor's note: This post has been updated with comments from President Biden.</em></p>]]>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its partner BioNTech plan to seek emergency authorization for a second COVID-19 booster shot for people 65 and older, Axios has confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The move is an attempt to combat waning immunity that occurs several months after a first booster shot, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/15/pfizer-second-booster-shot/" target="_blank"&gt;the Washington Post,&lt;/a&gt; which first reported the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The submission to the Food and Drug Administration is expected to include data from Israel, which is one of a few countries that have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/03/israel-covid-booster-fourth-dose-60/" target="_blank"&gt;authorized a second round of booster shots&lt;/a&gt; for anyone over 60, according to the Post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play:&lt;/strong&gt; Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pfizer-ceo-fourth-covid-shot-93498679-4063-4545-902f-5e9ac250494d.html" target="_blank"&gt;said on Sunday that a fourth dose&lt;/a&gt; of the COVID-19 vaccine "is necessary" to maintain manageable levels of hospitalizations and mild infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, NIAID director Anthony Fauci said last month that the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vaccines-omicron-boosters-israel-a1e931c0-4b93-4f45-b549-9ffe1c724a98.html" target="_self"&gt;possibility of another round of boosters&lt;/a&gt; was being "very carefully monitored."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; The decision from the FDA on whether to authorize a second booster dose for older Americans could come quickly, especially if the data provided does not require review by a panel of vaccine experts, per the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pfizer-ceo-fourth-covid-shot-93498679-4063-4545-902f-5e9ac250494d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pfizer CEO says fourth shot of COVID vaccine "necessary"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

More parents and caregivers reported struggling to cope with parenting demands and dealing with mental health issues of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More children were disconnected from the health system, as the proportion of uninsured children rose significantly and the proportion of children with adequate and continuous insurance declined. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specifically between 2019 and 2020 — covering the first year of the pandemic — there was an increase in children with behavioral or conduct problems, as well as a spike in child care disruptions that affected parental employment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preventive medical visits also decreased, and there was a 32% increase in reports of unmet health care needs between 2019 and 2020.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The good news: &lt;/strong&gt;There was a drop in household food insufficiency over the study period, including between 2019 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily reading also become more common among young children during the first year of the pandemic, and the proportion of kids getting enough sleep held steady.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Russia sanctions Biden, State Secretary Blinken and other Biden admin officials</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Russia has sanctioned President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and several other administration officials in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and commodities over Moscow's unprovoked &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/ukraine-update-china-looks-to-avoid-russia-sanctions-sideswipe?srnd=premium" target="_blank"&gt;per Bloomberg News. &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The sanctions, while largely symbolic and expected, still mark an escalation in hostilities between the U.S. and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sanctions would prohibit travel and freeze any assets held in Russia but not prevent high-level talks if they are planned, Bloomberg reported. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russia also sanctioned Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, press secretary Jen Psaki, CIA Director William Burns and other economic and financial officials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, were also included, but both do not currently serve in the U.S. government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Because of its invasion of Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-most-sanctioned-country-0de10d02-51aa-46c4-9711-bb45303fdfb8.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russia has surpassed Iran&lt;/a&gt; as the most sanctioned country in the world, while numerous Russian elites, including &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/putin-russia-ukraine-sanctions-82883e89-4e52-4ea0-be05-581f730a3631.html" target="_blank"&gt;President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, have been directly sanctioned by multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/poland-czech-republic-slovenia-zelensky-kyiv-b1423e34-3f6e-41b8-911f-b0837983da1a.html" target="_blank"&gt;3 European leaders to visit Zelensky in Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who was working as a consultant for Fox News, were killed Monday while newsgathering outside of Kyiv, the outlet's CEO Suzanne Scott said in an internal memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova were traveling alongside &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/fox-news-journalist-ukraine-e9d6964e-eec1-46af-ac6a-eb4147dd45bf.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall&lt;/a&gt; when their vehicle came under fire, Scott said. Hall remains hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Zakrzewski was based in London but had been in Ukraine covering the conflict since February, per the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grynbaum/status/1503749335766421506" target="_blank"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kuvshynova, 24, was helping Fox News crews "navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking to sources," Scott said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His death, reported first by Fox News, made him the second known journalist to have been killed in Ukraine, following the death of documentarian &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/american-journalist-killed-ukraine-624299bb-42aa-4b88-a0ff-2605c7e571fb.html" target="_blank"&gt;Brent Renaud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scott wrote that the network held off on announcing the news of Kuvshynova's death "out of respect for her family."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us.

    <title>3 European leaders to visit Zelensky in Kyiv as Russia continues strikes on capital</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia &lt;a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/primeminister/prime-ministers-visit-to-kyiv" target="_blank"&gt;will visit&lt;/a&gt; Kyiv on Tuesday to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and convey the European Union's "unequivocal support" for Ukraine on day 20 of Russia's invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest: &lt;/strong&gt;The dramatic visit comes as Ukraine still maintains control of Kyiv, though Russian forces continue to bombard targets — including residential and other civilian buildings — in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least four people were killed by a Russian strike against an apartment building and announced a 35-hour curfew beginning Tuesday night, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/15/world/ukraine-russia-war" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russian and Ukrainian delegations resumed negotiations on Tuesday, with Kyiv seeking the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country. Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelensky, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Podolyak_M/status/1503718859219554312" target="_blank"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that a potential ceasefire was discussed during the talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The International Committee of the Red Cross &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ICRC/status/1503730299175378946" target="_blank"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it is helping people evacuate Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine by leading two convoys of approximately 70 trucks, though it told the United Nations that it has been unable to deliver aid to people in besieged Mariupol, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/red-cross-hopes-evacuate-civilians-besieged-sumy-ukraine-2022-03-15/" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Authorities in Mariupol &lt;a href="https://t.me/mariupolrada/8865" target="_blank"&gt;said in a post on Telegram&lt;/a&gt; that a large group of civilians in 2,000 cars fled the besieged city along a humanitarian corridor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;By traveling to Kyiv, the three European leaders will be visiting an active war zone with the blessing of EU leadership, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: "&lt;/strong&gt;The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine," Poland's government said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The aim of this visit is also to present a broad package of support for the Ukraine and Ukrainians," it added.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;The EU also announced a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1503377015927357445" target="_blank"&gt;fourth sanctions package&lt;/a&gt; against Russia on Tuesday that in part revokes its "most favored nation" &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1502323425817333769" target="_blank"&gt;trade status&lt;/a&gt; and other World Trade Organization benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russia's invasion of Ukraine has &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/putin-eu-foreign-policy-superpower-ukraine-8c1bc3df-0e97-4e27-9de4-66f5911dd0c1.html" target="_blank"&gt;set off the EU's transformation&lt;/a&gt; into a foreign policy heavyweight by sanctioning Moscow and aiding Ukrainians with military and humanitarian goods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The invasion has set Ukraine on an accelerated path to EU membership while motivating other countries, such as &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/georgia-applies-eu-membership-ukraine-bef3cb3b-ec79-43a5-b868-1114f99f7b41.html" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, to apply to join the bloc as domestic support for Ukraine has galvanized calls to integrate with the West. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 3 million &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ukraine-refugees-russian-invasion-un-9f8b6e8e-87ed-4a5b-b7e9-d9229b373dca.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ukrainian refugees&lt;/a&gt; have escaped the invasion by entering Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other countries in what United Nations labeled the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_self"&gt;The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The global economic outlook depends on geopolitics</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A sense that the world is coming unglued — and that great-power geopolitics will ultimately shape economic destiny — hangs over global markets and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Aspects of how the world works that people have taken for granted for a generation have become deeply uncertain amid war in Europe, new pandemic lockdowns in China and high inflation in the U.S. that global developments stand to make worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The threats are to globalization itself,&lt;/strong&gt; and specifically the assumption that even countries that have big disagreements can do business with each other on an ever-widening scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, the faster and more efficient supply chains that companies have built over the course of decades are crumbling in new ways. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the weekend China announced a one-week lockdown of Shenzhen, an industrial powerhouse region that produces goods crucial to many global supply chains, due to a spike in COVID cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The shutdown is just the latest hit, at a time when war and sanctions are already straining supplies of commodities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play: &lt;/strong&gt;In effect, a collision is underway between powerful geopolitical and economic forces of a sort that are creating rapid whipsawing effects in markets as traders and policymakers try to make sense of this rapidly changing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused spiking prices for oil, wheat, and many metals on commodity markets (though those prices pulled back some on Monday), as the productive capacity of two large countries is essentially cut off from the rest of the global economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were reports that Russia has asked China for military assistance, which, if honored, would raise the possibility of the economic schism between Russia and the West expanding to include the world's second-largest economy most populous nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put it all together,&lt;/strong&gt; and the economic outlook is messy. Monday's market shifts reflected this unsettling time, with some surprising moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treasury bond yields soared to their highest levels since 2019 — contrary to the usual pattern in which times of crisis cause people to pour money into ultra-safe bonds, driving their yields downward. It's a sign that global investors are not counting on global uncertainty to bring about cheaper money like in the past.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil actually fell sharply, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 6.7% to a bit over $102 a barrel. This is welcome news for energy consumers, but the reason is less reassuring—it appears to be driven in part by expectations that Chinese lockdowns will depress demand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chinese stocks fell precipitously, with the Hang Seng index off nearly 5%. It reflected fears of both further lockdowns and possible further Chinese entanglement with Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;The thing about living through momentous times in history is you don't know how things are going to end. Markets, and all of us, are just trying to make sense of it in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The tech industry's dream of one global market is dying</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The tech world order that came together in the '90s at the Cold War's end is falling apart today as a new rift between Russia and the West opens and a great retrenchment begins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The breakup of the USSR in the early '90s opened an era in which internet use rapidly spread around the globe and U.S. tech companies viewed the entire planet as both factory floor and market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working from that assumption helped a handful of companies grow to previously inconceivable size, wealth and power. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the triple whammy of a "decoupling" between the U.S. and China, a global pandemic, and Russia's Ukraine invasion is rapidly shifting the landscape — and raising questions about how long those firms can maintain their colossal scale. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; A new COVID outbreak that's spread from Hong Kong to nearby Shenzhen, China, has led Foxconn — the gigantic Taiwan-based tech supplier — to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/chinas-covid-lockdowns-hit-apple-supplier-5b24e060-eb57-4b7a-a14d-b97c071d8388.html" target="_blank"&gt;temporarily close production complexes&lt;/a&gt; there that manufacture, among other things, Apple's iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The supply chain disruptions that could flow from further lockdowns in China cap two COVID years in which tech's products and services have grown even more essential for people around the world — even as companies' ability to provide them have faced new blockages and bottlenecks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time,&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine's plight has pushed many U.S.-based tech giants toward taking sides in a major international conflict, turning the power of their platforms toward blocking Russian state propaganda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's cheering to supporters of the Ukraine cause, but it also reminds governments around the world that they may not be able to count on those companies' products in a crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning in the '90s and accelerating after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, China became the tech industry's foundry. The   relationship brought benefits to both sides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But more recently, it &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/the-great-tech-decoupling-is-here-a98b2d78-c239-4267-b25b-159a21034ff9.html" target="_blank"&gt;began to unravel&lt;/a&gt;,  as U.S. distrust of China's government mounted, American awareness of China's human rights abuses grew, and China began to flex its muscles on the world stage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now  all that, plus the pandemic, &lt;/strong&gt;has left the U.S. in a "bring production home from overseas" mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, the Ukraine war is causing many countries, particularly those with authoritarian leaders, to think twice about welcoming U.S. tech giants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putin's war is also driving Russia &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/china-ukraine-proxy-war-arm-russia-86a101ed-04e2-4d0a-bce5-b25dd79022ff.html" target="_blank"&gt;deeper into an alliance with China&lt;/a&gt;, and any effort by China to supply Russia with arms will further deepen the gulf between Washington and Beijing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result is &lt;/strong&gt;the start of a vast withdrawal from a single global tech market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This grand decoupling goes beyond &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ukraine-conflict-splinters-global-internet-4abf05bb-a7c2-48f7-86d9-3c7f2553bea7.html" target="_blank"&gt;the "splinternet" phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; — the breaking up of the global internet into several different jurisdictional zones with different regulations and dominant powers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More broadly, the changes cast a long shadow over the tech industry's internationalist vision, suggesting that the past three decades of up-and-to-the-right growth may have peaked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; A restructured international tech order, with native companies providing more software, services and even devices, could be more diverse, resilient, and vibrant than today's world, in which a handful of companies serve billions of customers in largely the same ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; Decentralization is a watchword for industry visionaries, and that's exactly what's happening right now in the tech economy around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next:&lt;/strong&gt; A modest retrenchment could see some tech manufacturing return to the U.S. while software services become less global in ambition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more cataclysmic scenario has China deciding to follow Putin's revanchist lead and attack Taiwan, the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/threats-to-taiwan-nightmare-tech-847c1f30-d878-4eb9-b749-b2f17487dd91.html" target="_blank"&gt;center of the global semiconductor industry&lt;/a&gt; — likely leaving the industry, and the world, deeply broken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Partisanship undermines a playbook for the next pandemic</title>

    <title>Two years of information chaos</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;Data: Zignal Labs; Chart: Axios Visuals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public awareness around misinformation and disinformation has soared over the past two years, bringing information warfare and content moderation issues to the center of public conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: "&lt;/strong&gt;Whether they like it or not," everyday people have become "co-creators of today’s infosphere, which comes with responsibilities," said Tami Kim, assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"They have to be proactive in not just seeking out the truth, but also in gathering as many perspectives as possible before forming and sharing their own.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details: &lt;/strong&gt;New data from Zignal Labs, a social media analysis firm, found that conversations surrounding the topics of misinformation and disinformation began to grow significantly in 2020 and have only become more frequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In total, there have been more than 53 million mentions of misinformation and disinformation on Twitter since the start of 2019. Those mentions increased by 221% in 2020, compared to 2019. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The topic of mis- and disinformation started to become mainstream around the beginning of the pandemic, said Jennifer Granston, head of insights at Zignal Labs. The vaccine debate, in particular, helped fuel a new level of conversation around the impact of false information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today, the topic is a large part of all public conversations around any major news event, from COVID to elections to racial justice issues, and now Russia's invasion of Ukraine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The monthly volume of mis- and disinformation discussion on Twitter has recently spiked around the war in Ukraine to its second-highest level since the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joey Schafer, a researcher at the University of Washington Center for an Informed Public, noted that world leaders have become more publicly engaged in the topic now, which could be fueling that spike. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Even just focusing on the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, we’ve seen a Wikipedia editor arrested for spreading anti-Russian information in Belarus, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Ukraine making pleas to tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg asking for Russian media to be removed from Facebook, and the White House providing informational briefings to TikTok influencers," he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;As the public conversation around mis- and disinformation  becomes more prevalent, social media firms have been forced to act faster to address public concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, most major platforms took action on Russian state media accounts within days of the war's start, while it took tech platforms many months to finally begin taking action on anti-vaccine content at the start of the pandemic. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/" target="_blank"&gt;didn't ban&lt;/a&gt; the military in Myanmar from its platform until 2021, more than two years after the UN &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook-un-myanmar-genocide.php" target="_blank"&gt;slammed&lt;/a&gt; the tech giant for the role it played in spreading information used to legitimize a genocide against the Rohingya  population in that country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>War grows dangerous for journalists in Ukraine and Russia</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-war-journalists-dangers-2ec97a55-0dc2-4f71-bdef-05dfeb97022b.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of journalists are being killed, attacked, or threatened covering &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;the war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. Independent journalists are also facing threats trying to cover the conflict factually from Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Journalists covering the invasion are considered civilians under international humanitarian law. Targeting them can be considered a war crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting outside of Kyiv on Monday and is hospitalized, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/fox-news-journalist-ukraine-e9d6964e-eec1-46af-ac6a-eb4147dd45bf.html" target="_blank"&gt;the network said Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fox News hosts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BretBaier/status/1503445687735926788" target="_blank"&gt;took to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to send their colleague prayers and best wishes.  Details about Hall's condition remained unclear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The news came just one day after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/american-journalist-killed-ukraine-624299bb-42aa-4b88-a0ff-2605c7e571fb.html" target="_blank"&gt;killing of Brent Renaud&lt;/a&gt;, a Peabody award-winning filmmaker who was on assignment for Time in Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;News leaders are &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/news-leaders-mourn-killing-of-us-journalist-in-ukraine-urge-war-crimes-investigation-301501514.html" target="_blank"&gt;calling for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Renaud's death as a possible war crime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Renaud was the &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2022/03/ukrainian-camera-operator-yevhenii-sakun-killed-in-russian-shelling-of-kyiv-tv-tower/" target="_blank"&gt;second journalist&lt;/a&gt; confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country on Feb. 24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Ukrainian camera operator was &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2022/03/ukrainian-camera-operator-yevhenii-sakun-killed-in-russian-shelling-of-kyiv-tv-tower/" target="_blank"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; when a TV tower was shelled last week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russian forces &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sky-news-teams-harrowing-account-of-their-violent-ambush-in-ukraine-this-week-12557585" target="_blank"&gt;opened fire&lt;/a&gt; on Western journalists from Sky News last week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other journalists "have been &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2022/03/reporters-shot-shelled-robbed-while-covering-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/" target="_blank"&gt;shot at, shelled, robbed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2022/03/russian-forces-in-ukraine-detain-and-harass-journalists-while-authorities-clamp-down-on-russian-media/" target="_blank"&gt;detained&lt;/a&gt; by Russian forces" the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2022/03/hard-emotional-and-painful-journalists-in-ukraine-on-covering-russias-invasion/" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;For independent journalists in Russia, a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/putin-tests-limits-internet-truth-lockdown-cb45dd16-1b35-4ce7-88c8-8ad46be9e574.html" target="_blank"&gt;new "fake news" law&lt;/a&gt; has made it impossible to do their jobs without risking up to 15 years of jail time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CPJ said Russian authorities had so far detained at least 14 journalists covering anti-war protests. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart: &lt;/strong&gt;Most news organizations so far have yet to pull their journalists from Ukraine, but they have been more proactive about pulling staffers from Russia, given the legal threat journalists face there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The New York Times, for example, said last week it would &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/bbc-suspends-news-operations-russia-crackdown-war-308d6859-e424-4d5f-a4c4-6830c8a51ef8.html" target="_blank"&gt;pull all of its journalists&lt;/a&gt; out of Russia, but it kept journalists on the ground covering the war in Ukraine, as did other news organizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Instances of journalists being targeting during Russia's invasion "is a reminder to the world of why a free and independent press is so important and worthy of protection and support," said Jen Judson, president of the National Press Club and Gil Klein, president of the National Press Club Journalism Institute, in a joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;More than two dozen governments, including the U.S., &lt;a href="https://mediafreedomcoalition.org/activities/joint-statements/2022/media-freedom-coalition-statement-on-russia-s-invasion-of-ukraine-and-assault-on-media-freedom" target="_blank"&gt;have spoken out&lt;/a&gt; in support of press freedom surrounding the war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Refugee groups warn of trafficking risk for fleeing Ukrainians</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/human-trafficking-ukraine-refugees-risk-d4827a30-48e6-443c-abe7-59553b0b26cd.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The grassroots efforts across Europe to help and house Ukrainians arriving in unfamiliar countries have helped thousands find refuge, but could also be a human trafficker's “dream," refugee advocates are warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;Almost 3 million people — mostly women and children — have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, &lt;a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine" target="_blank"&gt;according to the U.N. refugee agency&lt;/a&gt;. The vast majority have sought refuge in Poland, which has taken in more than 1.7 million refugees in the last 19 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the ground: &lt;/strong&gt;Daphne Panayotatos of Refugees International visited several border crossings into Poland last week, where hundreds of traumatized Ukrainians were greeted with free SIM cards, blankets, meals, and offers of rides. Hopefully, most people are well-intentioned, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-today-podcast-human-trafficking-refugees-ukraine-russia-900dce55-88fd-4566-a006-d5d4f8f24103.html" target="_blank"&gt;she told Axios&lt;/a&gt;, but added:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Someone’s holding a cardboard sign that says ‘I can take three people to Berlin’ and who knows? It’s really creating a huge risk and without proper structures in place to register people, we could see some really negative consequences of this.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World Vision Romania's Andreea Bujor notes that Romania, where over 400,000 Ukrainians have arrived, was already known as a hub of human trafficking. The priority when the war began was to provide emergency aid as quickly as possible, but now "we have to think about these things, too," Bujor says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;Yesterday, the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/berlin-warns-ukrainian-refugees-about-trafficking-danger-2022-03-14/" target="_blank"&gt;City of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; began warning Ukrainian refugees arriving by train to be careful of offers of money or accommodation, over concern they could be trafficked or forced into prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/berlin-warns-ukrainian-refugees-about-trafficking-danger-2022-03-14/" target="_blank"&gt;Germany’s interior ministry says&lt;/a&gt; more than 300,000 private homes have been offered as shelter for refugees. But the German government is now asking people to register their homes with the government, rather than approaching people individually. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polish authorities on Thursday &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-immigration-moldova-poland-europe-17c62dbeb4c88e04e7253865bc20c9f0" target="_blank"&gt;detained a 49-year-old man&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly raping a 19-year-old Ukrainian woman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aid groups are particularly concerned&lt;/strong&gt; about the risks for children who were unaccompanied or separated from families, a danger highlighted by &lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2022/3/622619a24/unaccompanied-separated-children-fleeing-escalating-conflict-ukraine-must.html" target="_blank"&gt;UNICEF and UNHCR&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An estimated 100,000 children live in orphanages and institutions in Ukraine, according to a Monday release by Save the Children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"These children are some of the most vulnerable in Ukraine and face a heightened risk of trafficking, abuse, and other forms of exploitation," Save the Children’s Eastern Europe director Irina Saghoyan said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch: &lt;/strong&gt;A coordinated, regional response is key, Panayotatos said, because if one neighboring country has weaker controls traffickers will simply go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom out&lt;/strong&gt;: A &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/third-report-progress-made-fight-against-trafficking-human-beings_en" target="_blank"&gt;2020 report from the European Commission&lt;/a&gt; said its “conservative estimate” is that human traffickers made 29.4 billion euros annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-today-podcast-human-trafficking-refugees-ukraine-russia-900dce55-88fd-4566-a006-d5d4f8f24103.html" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the full conversation with Daphne Panayotatos on Axios Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Women drivers still get short shrift in new 5-star safety ratings</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/vehicle-safety-ratings-gender-gap-8a551461-b419-4e4a-986f-18e655e20f03.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Significant updates proposed to the federal government's flagship &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings" target="_blank"&gt;5-Star Safety Rating&lt;/a&gt; program do nothing to address the higher risk faced by female drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters: &lt;/strong&gt;Women face a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/gender-gap-car-safety-leaves-women-risk-bb125ad8-cf13-4546-a4d1-21634e450b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; than men of being seriously injured or killed in a crash — but most vehicle safety systems are tested using male crash test dummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing safety technologies to protect "the average male" leaves everyone else more vulnerable, safety advocates say. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; The updates suggested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) lean heavily on new driver-assistance technologies to try to make automobiles safer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among the proposals:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Institure more stringent testing of NHTSA-recommended technologies and of four new ones: lane-keeping support, pedestrian automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection and blind spot intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potentially add technologies related to driver distraction, alcohol detection and driver monitoring systems, among others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider a new crash avoidance rating for driver-assistance technologies that could be displayed on the car's window sticker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; The proposed updates don't address the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/gender-gap-car-safety-leaves-women-risk-bb125ad8-cf13-4546-a4d1-21634e450b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;existing gender gap&lt;/a&gt; in vehicle safety testing, says former Rep. Susan Molinari, co-chair of a safety coalition called Verity (Vehicle Equity Rules in Transportation) Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Until we require up-to-date female dummies in all crash tests, as the rule proposes to do for men, the U.S. government is sending a signal that it doesn’t believe women’s lives are as important as men’s,” Molinari said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHTSA acknowledges that women face a higher risk&lt;/strong&gt; of dying in a crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Although men consistently represent more than 70 percent of drivers involved in fatal crashes, when comparable crashes are analyzed and risk taking differences are accounted for, studies have shown that motor vehicle fatality risk is, on average, 17 percent higher for a female than for a male of the same age," per its newly released &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/nrss/usdot-national-roadway-safety-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;National Roadway Safety Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Men are riskier drivers, which is why they account for 70% of the overall fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But in comparable crashes, women are more likely to die because their bodies differ in terms of size, bone density and muscle structure. They also sit closer to the steering wheel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The standard crash test dummy is a 50th-percentile male that represents the average U.S. soldier in the 1960s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A female dummy, added in the early 2000s, represents a 5th-percentile woman — under 5 feet tall and 108 pounds — and thus doesn't consider the other 95% of women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no test dummies available to represent midsize women, but NHTSA uses computer simulation to fill the gap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;A NHTSA spokesperson says its 5-Star Safety Ratings system — also known as the New Car Assessment Program — has improved safety for all vehicle occupants, and the regulations "appear to have also significantly reduced gender disparity in crash outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure law enacted in 2021 aims to accelerate research into eliminating gender disparities in deaths and injuries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where it stands: &lt;/strong&gt;NHTSA has a 60-day comment period on the proposed rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; NHTSA plans to propose a new, more lifelike dummy from Humantics called the &lt;a href="https://humanetics.humaneticsgroup.com/products/anthropomorphic-test-devices/frontal-impact/thor-50m/thor-50m" target="_blank"&gt;THOR-50M&lt;/a&gt;. It is also based on the 50th-percentile male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://humanetics.humaneticsgroup.com/products/anthropomorphic-test-devices/frontal-impact/thor-5f" target="_blank"&gt;5th-percentile female THOR dummy&lt;/a&gt; could come later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/gender-gap-car-safety-leaves-women-risk-bb125ad8-cf13-4546-a4d1-21634e450b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;The gender gap in car safety leaves women at risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Axios-Ipsos poll: Americans ditch COVID masks, gain confidence</title>

    <description>&lt;div&gt;Data: Axios/Ipsos poll; Chart: Will Chase/Axios&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans' emotional and physical health is bouncing back, along with record confidence about life returning to "normal" as mask mandates are abandoned, according to the latest installment of the &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index" target="_blank"&gt;Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Two years after the start of the pandemic, the nation is ready to move on, even as disinformation at home and a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/covid-spike-in-europe-could-signal-increase-in-us-5157d64d-a4de-452a-9be5-ec6992658655.html" target="_blank"&gt;resurgence of cases in Europe&lt;/a&gt; driven by the B.A.2 variant point to challenges on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;64% of survey respondents now favor federal, state and local governments lifting all COVID-19 restrictions, up 20 percentage points since early February.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But three in four say they'd go back to masking if infections increase again where they live.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;"As the mandates ended, behaviors changed across the board," said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos U.S. Public Affairs. "The mandate itself was signaling risk, and as the mandate went down that signal went dormant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers: &lt;/strong&gt;Just 27% of those surveyed said state or local government mask mandates were still in place where they live, down from 36% at the end of February and 42% at the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;39% of those who work said their employers were still requiring them to wear masks in the workplace, down from 52% at the end of last month and 60% at the start of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, 83% of respondents describe their physical health as good and 84% say their state of emotional well-being is good, the highest shares for both since May 2020. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;75% said the country is moving toward a time when COVID won't interrupt daily life, up from 66% last month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; 56% of Americans still say coronavirus can't be eradicated in the U.S. within the next year. And 61% say they're still worried about the possibility of getting sick — a clear majority, even though it's the lowest share in our surveys since April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But just one in three says returning to pre-COVID life&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;now would present a large or moderate risk, down from four in 10 last month and six in 10 at the start of the year. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One in three says they've already returned to normal life, a survey high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 4% see a large risk in working indoors in an office, a survey low, while 29% see no risk at all, a survey high. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, but, but:&lt;/strong&gt; "While we're definitely seeing this movement toward opening up, public understanding of what's going on is still not super-duper strong," cautioned Ipsos pollster and senior vice president Chris Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only one in three respondents were aware that more than 1,000 people in the U.S. each day are still dying from the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less than half knew that far more people have died from the virus than have experienced negative effects from the vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And more than one in five either said "true" or "don't know" when asked whether they believe microchips were implanted via the vaccine to track recipients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; 48% of survey respondents said "hopeful" describes the way they feel today — the highest share since this time last year when vaccines were becoming broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodology: This Axios/Ipsos Poll was conducted March 11-14 by Ipsos' KnowledgePanel®.

    <title>The Zelensky leadership model: Courage in terrible times</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-leadership-courage-6446e3bc-da69-4ac2-8578-a80ed12e6633.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of our favorite mantras &lt;/strong&gt;at Axios &lt;em&gt;(pardon the language): &lt;/em&gt;When shit happens, shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea is simple. Anyone can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; — or &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; — good when it's easy. Real character is carved in terrible or tumultuous times&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/strong&gt; is showing in real time how to dig deep into places you didn’t know existed to find a better, more courageous version of yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seize the moment.&lt;/strong&gt; There's that &lt;a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechmiracle3.html" target="_blank"&gt;memorable line&lt;/a&gt; in "Miracle," the movie about the 1980 U.S. hockey team upsetting, ironically, the Russians: "Great moments are born from great opportunity." Zelensky has risen to the moment as an eloquent wartime leader. All of us confront lesser moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Zelensky could flee or hide, but instead he has plunged fully into leading his people. Too often we duck from the tough stuff or hide in our own fears. But courage is contagious — and lurks inside even the most timid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch your words.&lt;/strong&gt; Words stick. Words move people. Think hard about how to explain to others what needs to be done. Do it with grace but directness. There's a reason this tight &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/06/zelenskys-famous-quote-need-ammo-not-ride-not-easily-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Zelensky statement&lt;/a&gt; echoed worldwide: "I need ammunition, not a ride."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ya never know.&lt;/strong&gt; Zelensky was a reality TV star — a joke of a politician to many before Vladimir Putin invaded. There was little in Zelensky's past to suggest heroism. That's the great lesson of my life: The most unlikely people rise in the most unlikely of moments. You could be one of them. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the big things right.&lt;/strong&gt; Before this crisis, there were real questions about Zelensky’s preparedness and judgment. We all carry baggage. But nailing the moments that matter most is a worthy legacy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quote with pop... &lt;/strong&gt;Zelensky, in &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ukraine-zelensky-capitol-riots-axios-hbo-f223c6d4-1aee-4779-a26d-f5f0eefb90f2.html" target="_blank"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Jonathan Swan for "Axios on HBO," in Kyiv in January 2021: "I really want the people of the United States of America to understand that Ukraine is having a difficult time, to understand that Ukraine is strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I know Ukraine is changing every day.

    <title>U.S. warns China against a superpower proxy war in Ukraine</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/china-ukraine-proxy-war-arm-russia-86a101ed-04e2-4d0a-bce5-b25dd79022ff.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;In an "intense" seven-hour meeting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi on Monday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned of "consequences" if Beijing materially supports &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russia's war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, a senior U.S. official briefed reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; China is already providing its most powerful partner with tacit support, but U.S. officials are now trying to draw red lines to prevent a full-on superpower proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news: &lt;/strong&gt;The FT's Demetri Sevastopulo &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/52ea7aab-f8d1-46b6-9d66-18545c5ef9b9" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. has warned allies in a diplomatic cable that China has "signaled its willingness" to provide Russia with weapons. Those include surface-to-air missiles, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While China's next moves remain uncertain, fears are growing that Washington and Beijing could end up arming either side in a brutal land war — potentially escalating and prolonging it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Far beyond the battlefield, such a move would herald an even more adversarial era in U.S.-China relations, says Hal Brands of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Sanctions and economic decoupling would "find a new gear," and remaining hopes of a constructive relationship would evaporate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. official declined to comment on the potential arms transfers, but said Sullivan shared “deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia” and warned of the “potential consequences of certain actions” during Monday's meeting in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The meeting was planned weeks in advance and also covered other issues like North Korea, the U.S. official said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beijing has denied receiving any request for weapons from Moscow, and it has not armed parties to other recent inter-state conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of play:&lt;/strong&gt; In official public statements, China has presented itself as a neutral arbiter, a defender of sovereignty and international norms, and even a potential peace broker. China abstained from a UN vote condemning Russia, rather than back its most powerful partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While Chinese government spokespeople have blamed the U.S. and NATO for Russia’s invasion — and aren't actually using the word “invasion” — they’re calling for restraint on all sides. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;China’s state propaganda machine has picked sides, however. State media is spreading baseless conspiracy theories about supposed U.S. bioweapons labs, government censors are scrubbing any reports of civilian casualties, and Chinese internet forums are full of support for Moscow and vitriol for NATO, as the Economist’' David Rennie &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1501996890690404355" target="_blank"&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“If you’re Chinese and watching state TV or looking at the heavily censored internet here, you would believe that Russian troops are behaving with extraordinary restraint, that they are there to dislodge Nazis from Ukraine, and that the Americans are the ones pouring fuel on the fire,” Rennie notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping made relations with Russia a pillar of his foreign policy, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/putin-xi-summit-olympis-ukraine-taiwan-11b2dc10-f90c-46a0-a752-aac862334adb.html" target="_blank"&gt;and he appeared with&lt;/a&gt; Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin before the invasion in a show of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But the war is going badly for Russia on the battlefield and, in particular, in terms of global public opinion. It has united the West and placed additional focus on Taiwan. All of that is costly for Beijing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The costs will increase if China helps Russia evade sanctions or offers more overt diplomatic support. They will rise higher still if Xi sends weapons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, Xi may calculate that he needs a strong Russia to occupy U.S. attention and that a catastrophic outcome in Ukraine could destabilize the Putin regime, Brands notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Xi's big bet on relations with Putin had been relatively low-risk before now. The U.S. wants to convince him that if he doubles down over Ukraine, he'll come to regret it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>In an "intense" seven-hour meeting<strong> </strong>with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi on Monday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned of "consequences" if Beijing materially supports<a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates-873196c6-15a2-47a0-8360-e3db5af96b3c.html" target="_blank">Russia's war in Ukraine</a>, a senior U.S. official briefed reporters.</p><p><strong>The big picture:</strong> China is already providing its most powerful partner with tacit support, but U.S. officials are now trying to draw red lines to prevent a full-on superpower proxy war.</p><hr><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The FT's Demetri Sevastopulo<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/52ea7aab-f8d1-46b6-9d66-18545c5ef9b9" target="_blank">reports</a> that the U.S. has warned allies in a diplomatic cable that China has "signaled its willingness" to provide Russia with weapons.

    <title>Inflation is hitting battleground states worse, upping stakes for Dems</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/inflation-is-hitting-battleground-states-worse-71f3ecec-37fc-48a3-9432-55f82ac94471.html</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt; Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Table: Thomas Oide/Axios &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price hikes affecting Americans nationally have been even worse in battleground states since the beginning of the pandemic, Axios found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the most sensitive voters politically are the ones feeling price hikes most sharply. During an already volatile midterm year for Democrats, inflation concerns have prompted the party to focus its messaging on lowering costs and cutting taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The details: &lt;/strong&gt;Axios calculated the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from February 2020, just before the pandemic, to last month, which provided the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was then compared to the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CPI's U.S. city average in February 2020 was 257.97; in February 2022, it was 281.15 — a growth of 8.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflation in urban areas in Florida, Georgia and Arizona has been significantly higher than that U.S. city average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Atlanta area, the change was 11.7%. In Florida, the Tampa- and Miami-area differences were 11.8% and 10.2%, respectively. In the urban areas in Arizona, the difference was 10.7%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In West Coast cities, including the Nevada battleground of Las Vegas, the difference was 8.4% — just higher than the U.S. national city average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought bubble:&lt;/strong&gt; The higher rates in these battleground areas stem from the fact they possess characteristics correlating with high inflation, Axios’ chief economic correspondent Neil Irwin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They include factors such as an influx of residents and lots of college-educated adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They earn higher salaries, tend to bid up rents and have sufficient disposable income, allowing restaurants and stores to raise prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we’re watching:&lt;/strong&gt; President Biden has made a concerted effort to blame recent gas price hikes on the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, illustrating the Democratic pushback on inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biden argues the pain Americans are feeling at the pump is a direct result of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question is whether timely political messaging will be enough for Democrats to win over vital voters in their quest to keep their congressional majorities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they’re saying: &lt;/strong&gt;David Bergstein, spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, painted a contrast between Democrats and Republicans in a statement to Axios. He argued it would be what ultimately leads to Republican losses in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“While Senate Democrats are fighting to lower costs and cut taxes, Senate Republicans want to raise taxes on over half of all Americans and spike the cost of health care," he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Democratic operative working on Senate battleground campaigns said that beyond making an argument about lowering costs, some candidates will be adding a "more populist" message around price gouging, and holding corporate America accountable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing the annual House Democratic retreat&lt;/strong&gt; last week, the president said the party needs to do a better job explaining inflation to Americans “just trying to stay above the water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He specifically noted their messaging needs to focus on the idea that price hikes are not a result of government spending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side: &lt;/strong&gt;Republicans aim to capitalize regardless of the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The Democrats’ ever-changing and increasingly incoherent arguments for why they're not to blame are an insult to the intelligence of the American people," Chris Hartline, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Woman crashes Russian newscast, protests Ukrainian invasion</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A woman was reportedly detained for protesting the invasion of Ukraine during a live newscast on Monday, calling for an end to the war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman stood behind a state-run Channel One broadcaster, holding a sign that read "Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They’re lying to you." She simultaneously shouted “Stop the war! No to war!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines: &lt;/strong&gt;The woman is Marina Ovsyannikova, an employee at Channel One, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OvdInfo/status/1503470185696669701" target="_blank"&gt;according to OVD-Info&lt;/a&gt;, an independent Russian human rights media group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ovsyannikova appears to have filmed a video prior to the demonstration, which OVD-Info also released, where she apologized for helping manufacture "Kremlin propaganda."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"What's happening in Ukraine is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor," Ovsyannikova said in the video, according to a translation. "The responsibility for this aggression lies with one man: Vladimir Putin."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She added: "Unfortunately, for the last few years I've been working for Channel One. I've been doing Kremlin propaganda and I'm very ashamed of it – that I let people lie from TV screens and allowed the Russian people to be zombified."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pavel Chikov, whose legal defense fund is representing Ovsyannikova, confirmed that the Channel One worker has since been arrested. She's facing charges of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1503453848786059270?cxt=HHwWjICykerTq90pAAAA" target="_blank"&gt;"discrediting the Russian armed forces."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin has cracked down on independent media and social networks since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Russian lawmakers passed legislation on March 4 that would punish journalists and individuals with up to 15 years in prison for publishing what Moscow deems to be "fake" information about the war.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloomberg and BBC have suspended operations in Russia, and CNN, CBS and ABC have &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/bbc-suspends-news-operations-russia-crackdown-war-308d6859-e424-4d5f-a4c4-6830c8a51ef8.html" target="_blank"&gt;stopped broadcasting in the country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/russia-blocks-access-to-facebook-11269b1c-06b2-409e-bee0-405a9a45fbe9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russia has also blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter and Instagram in the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

    <title>Idaho legislature passes Texas-style six week abortion ban</title>
    <link>https://www.axios.com/idaho-texas-style-abortion-ban-ab9adda3-159d-4073-8e7a-0791d5211570.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An Idaho bill outlawing abortions after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant, is now heading to the governor for a signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Following &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/texas-abortion-ban-effect-f41bef97-09ac-4062-a933-d435a7e892d4.html" target="_blank"&gt;Texas' six-week abortion ban&lt;/a&gt;, Idaho could become the second state in the U.S. to effectively ban the procedure after six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; Idaho's House voted 51-14 on Monday to approve legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/14/abortion-ban-idaho-texas/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJpZCI6IjEwMDkzMDk4IiwicmVhc29uIjoiZ2lmdCIsIm5iZiI6MTY0NzI5MTc3OCwiaXNzIjoic3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ucyIsImV4cCI6MTY0ODUwMTM3OCwiaWF0IjoxNjQ3MjkxNzc4LCJqdGkiOiI1YzU3N2RkYS1jMmU0LTRmM2EtODZhNS00NjVmYzU4ZTE2YjgiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMi8wMy8xNC9hYm9ydGlvbi1iYW4taWRhaG8tdGV4YXMvIn0.pCGxNzDuILeCeFlz1l7xNXby4xsLDweAK-0h5zMIEAk" target="_blank"&gt;the Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Idaho Senate approved the Republican-backed bill earlier this month and the law now heads to Gov.
